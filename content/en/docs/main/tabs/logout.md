Used for logging out of the system. Use this also before you start Qm+ again, for example, before clicking on a link in an email you have received. When you click on such a link without having logged out first, you will be logged out automatically. You will then have to click on the link in the email again.

Clicking on Log out will take you to the login screen. From there, you can click on the company logo if you need to log in to another company, for example, if you want to go from a test database to a real database. Or you can simply log in again after writing your username and password as usual.
