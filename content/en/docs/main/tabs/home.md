  Home is a tab on the Main Page.

# 
It is by default the starting page for users with access to the simplified interface, but that can be changed on a customer level.

The page contains only buttons that correspond to the tabs the logged in user has access to. The customer's super user can adjust which modules are active. Therefore, it may be that not all buttons described below appear in your screen. The available buttons are:

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Register-message_16px.png" >}} Register a new message: Choose a button with the name of a message form to register a new message.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Messages_16px.png" >}} Messages: Register a new message and get an overview of your registered messages.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Actions_16px.png" >}} Actions: Actions you have to execute and overview of the executed actions. Not included in the standard version.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Questionnaires_16px.png" >}} Questionnaires: Checklists, risk analysis lists and survey forms you have to fill out. If you have answered an activity by clicking on a link in an email, you can open this page to modify your answer until the deadline for the activity expires.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Info_16px.png" >}} Info: Look at laws, rules, information and other documents that are relevant to your company.
