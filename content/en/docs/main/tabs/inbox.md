The inbox is used for following up cases you have to do something about.

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/User.png" >}} Cases I am responsible for shows cases that the logged in user has to work with.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/User.png" >}} All cases I have been involved in show all cases the user has worked with, including all the messages that the logged in user has registered, regardless of department.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Chart_organisation.png" >}} Department cases shows cases that the selected department is working with. Cases I am responsible for are not affected by the selected department in the Navigator, but the Department cases are.

Pink cases are messages, yellow cases are actions, blue-gray cases are hearings.

This page remembers the page number and sorting column when you visit another page and then return to it. The state is remembered for one hour or until the user presses the Log out button on the top row. It is also forgotten if the user opens another page that has a similar table.

### {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Info.png" >}} What can I do here?

- Here I can register a new message: Click on the yellow (green or red) button at the bottom of the page.
- I can handle cases that have been sent to me: Click on a case in the table.
- I can see cases that are being handled in other departments by selecting a department in the Navigator and then clicking on Department cases.

### Options

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Application_form_edit.png" >}} Register new message: Select a message form to register a new message. Opens the Edit message page. The message forms are displayed as individual buttons if there are up to 4 different forms. If there are more, the button {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Application_form_add.png" >}} Register new message must be pressed first. It opens a list of all active message forms.
- All cases drop-down menu: If you select a message form, only cases originating from such a form are shown. You can also select to see only the hearings.
- My current cases / All cases I have been involved in: When "My current cases" is selected, only cases that the logged in user should do something about are shown. When "All cases I have been involved in" is selected, the list shown below includes also the cases that the logged in user has done something about but they are not closed yet.

### Table

- When you click on a line of the main table, the selected case will open in its handling page. Messages open in the Message process page, actions open in the Action process page and hearings open in the Reply to a hearing page.
- Hold the cursor over the + symbol in the first column to get more information about a case.
- Change page: The buttons named First, Previous, Next, Last and any numbered buttons in between, are used to change the page when there are more than 20 cases that can be shown in the table.

### Icons

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Sort_down.png" >}} and {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/No_sort.png" >}} Sorting: The table is sorted by the column with the {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Sort_down.png" >}}. Click on the {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/No_sort.png" >}} to sort by that column.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Flag_green.png" >}}, {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Flag_yellow.png" >}}, {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Flag_red.png" >}} symbolize low, medium and high priority respectively.

### Tabs

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/User.png" >}} Cases I am responsible for: Displays the cases that the logged in user has to work with.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/User.png" >}} All cases I have been involved in: Displays the cases that the logged in user has worked with. Cases the user is only informed with are not included in this view.
