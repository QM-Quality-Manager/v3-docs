# Home
{{< onlystaticimg src="/images/House.png" >}} Home is a tab on the Main Page. It is by default the starting page for users with access to the simplified interface, but that can be changed on a customer level.

The page contains only buttons that correspond to the tabs the logged in user has access to. The customer's super user can adjust which modules are active. Therefore, it may be that not all buttons described below appear in your screen. The available buttons are:

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Register-message_16px.png" >}} Register a new message: Choose a button with the name of a message form to register a new message.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Messages_16px.png" >}} Messages: Register a new message and get an overview of your registered messages.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Actions_16px.png" >}} Actions: Actions you have to execute and overview of the executed actions. Not included in the standard version.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Questionnaires_16px.png" >}} Questionnaires: Checklists, risk analysis lists and survey forms you have to fill out. If you have answered an activity by clicking on a link in an email, you can open this page to modify your answer until the deadline for the activity expires.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Info_16px.png" >}} Info: Look at laws, rules, information and other documents that are relevant to your company.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Preferences_16px.png" >}} Preferences: Edit your user information.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Help_16px.png" >}} Help: See the documentation about the system. User manuals, guidelines and links to the change log for Qm+.

# Inbox
{{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Table_edit.png" >}} Inbox is a tab on the Main Page.

The inbox is used for following up cases you have to do something about.

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/User.png" >}} Cases I am responsible for shows cases that the logged in user has to work with.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/User.png" >}} All cases I have been involved in show all cases the user has worked with, including all the messages that the logged in user has registered, regardless of department.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Chart_organisation.png" >}} Department cases shows cases that the selected department is working with. Cases I am responsible for are not affected by the selected department in the Navigator, but the Department cases are.

Pink cases are messages, yellow cases are actions, blue-gray cases are hearings.

This page remembers the page number and sorting column when you visit another page and then return to it. The state is remembered for one hour or until the user presses the Log out button on the top row. It is also forgotten if the user opens another page that has a similar table.

### {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Info.png" >}} What can I do here?

- Here I can register a new message: Click on the yellow (green or red) button at the bottom of the page.
- I can handle cases that have been sent to me: Click on a case in the table.
- I can see cases that are being handled in other departments by selecting a department in the Navigator and then clicking on Department cases.

### Options

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Application_form_edit.png" >}} Register new message: Select a message form to register a new message. Opens the Edit message page. The message forms are displayed as individual buttons if there are up to 4 different forms. If there are more, the button {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Application_form_add.png" >}} Register new message must be pressed first. It opens a list of all active message forms.
- All cases drop-down menu: If you select a message form, only cases originating from such a form are shown. You can also select to see only the hearings.
- My current cases / All cases I have been involved in: When "My current cases" is selected, only cases that the logged in user should do something about are shown. When "All cases I have been involved in" is selected, the list shown below includes also the cases that the logged in user has done something about but they are not closed yet.

### Table

- When you click on a line of the main table, the selected case will open in its handling page. Messages open in the Message process page, actions open in the Action process page and hearings open in the Reply to a hearing page.
- Hold the cursor over the + symbol in the first column to get more information about a case.
- Change page: The buttons named First, Previous, Next, Last and any numbered buttons in between, are used to change the page when there are more than 20 cases that can be shown in the table.

### Icons

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Sort_down.png" >}} and {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/No_sort.png" >}} Sorting: The table is sorted by the column with the {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Sort_down.png" >}}. Click on the {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/No_sort.png" >}} to sort by that column.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Flag_green.png" >}}, {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Flag_yellow.png" >}}, {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Flag_red.png" >}} symbolize low, medium and high priority respectively.

### Tabs

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/User.png" >}} All cases I have been involved in: Displays the cases that the logged in user has worked with. Cases the user is only informed with are not included in this view.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Chart_organisation.png" >}} Department cases: Displays the cases that the users of the selected department have to work with.

# Admin
{{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Admin.png" >}} Admin is a tab on the Main Page.

Admin is used for managing the system. The access is controlled by the system role Admin. In the standard version, all the managers have full access to edit all information within their own organisation. For some customers this option is limited and therefore they will not get all the tabs that are described below. Contact your local super user if you feel that you need additional rights.

All information displayed / posted via Admin will relate to the selected department in the Navigator.

### {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Info.png" >}} What can I do here?

- As a Super user, I have access to the ADMIN-tab. This tab opens new tabs where I can make changes in the organisation (navigator), add users in the departments, change the categories that will be inserted in message forms, create forms, add new managing documents, etc.
- A click on each of the tabs under ADMIN provides access to new tabs.

### Buttons

# Home dashboard
{{< onlystaticimg src="/images/House.png" >}} Home dashboard is a tab on the Main Page and is the start page for the complete interface. In this page, each user can decide which components will be shown. If no components have been selected, the default set of components will be shown.

- Press the Configure dashboard button to select the components that should appear on the page. Changes made by the user are saved automatically.
- Click the Register new message button to open the list with the available message forms. This is the same list that you get from the Inbox page.

# Info
{{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Info_16px.png" >}} Info is a tab on the Main Page.

Used to display the document overview in the system. The documents are organised in different areas of the screen. They can also be distributed under multiple tabs. The document structure is determined by the company's local super user. {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Collapse.png" >}} and {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Expand.png" >}} are used to expand and collapse the subdocuments of documents. There is also a search function here that performs free text searches in all the documents that appear in this page.

The document names function as links. Click on a document name to open the document. Especially for documents created in Qm+: You can either open the HTML version by clicking on the document name, or you can get a PDF version of the document by clicking on the {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_white_acrobat.png" >}} icon on the right of the document name.

When clicking on the {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_white_acrobat.png" >}} icon on the right of documents written in Qm+ that have subdocuments (they have the {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Expand.png" >}} icon in front of them), you get a popup window where you can select if you want the exported .pdf to include only the current document or also its subdocuments.

Folders that contain documents written in Qm+ also have a pdf icon, which prints all such documents in the selected folder in one .pdf file. The pdf report from a folder includes also all sub-documents of internal documents in the printed file (not just the sub-documents of folders). This is intended to correct the problem that arises when one has written each chapter of a big document in a separate Qm+ document and wants to print the entire document as a whole.

You can also get the document in .docx format by clicking on the {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_white_word.png" >}} icon. The option for exporting to .docx is not included in the standard version. If you want this option enabled, contact drift@qmplus.com. Please note that the .pdf version is the most suitable for printing. At this point, we cannot guarantee that the .docx produced file will look the same in all editors or that it will open correctly in all versions of Microsoft Office or OpenOffice. This export format should only be used when there is a need for manually updating the report. This functionality is still in test mode.

Documents can appear directly in this page under separate tabs instead of having the name of the document appear as a link. This functionality has to be ordered separately. Contact drift@qmplus.com if you want such a solution.

### Info.png What can I do here?

- I can search for documents: Click the "Search"-button at the bottom of the page.
- I can select between Tabs and Document groups to search in specific document collections.
- All the documents under INFO may be attached to different forms and categories such as message forms.

### Functions

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Printer.png" >}} Print: Prints the current screen.

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Help.png" >}} Help: Opens this page.

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Find.png" >}} Search: Searches for the text that is written in the text field in front of the button. The search results depend on the department which is selected in the navigator, but not on the selected document tab. The search function uses the search engine Lucene.
  - Beneath the title of each document found in the search, the location of the document is displayed. It is shown as Document tab / Document group / Any parent document(s) / Document title.
  - When a free text search has been done, a set of search filters is displayed above the search results. The values in the filter are not affected by changing the department in the navigator and will remain until you click Close search results.
    - Document tab: Include documents from all or just the selected document tab.
    - Document group: Include documents from all or just the selected document group.
    - Department choice: Include documents from all documents available at the selected department or just the documents registered at the selected department.
  - Tip: Include only interesting words. For example, if you wish to search for procedures related to fire, use the keywords "procedures fire".
  - Advanced: See Lucene Query Syntax for detailed information about the syntax for the search field.
    - Searchable fields: Text, URL, DocumentId, Name, Information.
    - If no fields are specified, all fields are searched. In that case, extra weight is given to the name field.

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Heart_add.png" >}} Add to favourites: This function is available for users who have the system role Info_Favourite documents, and for all documents except those of type Folder. The icon appears when the user moves the cursor over a document. Clicking on it marks the document as a Favourite document. These documents can later be found in the Favourite documents tab.

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Heart_delete.png" >}} Remove from favourites: This function is available for users who have the system role Info_Favourite documents, and for all documents except those of type Folder. The icon appears when the user moves the cursor over a document that has been marked as a Favourite before. Clicking on it unmarks the specific document as a Favourite and removes it from the Favourite documents tab.
