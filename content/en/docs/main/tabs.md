# Home
{{< onlystaticimg src="/images/House.png" >}} Home is a tab on the Main Page. It is by default the starting page for users with access to the simplified interface, but that can be changed on a customer level.

The page contains only buttons that correspond to the tabs the logged in user has access to. The customer's super user can adjust which modules are active. Therefore, it may be that not all buttons described below appear in your screen. The available buttons are:

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Register-message_16px.png" >}} Register a new message: Choose a button with the name of a message form to register a new message.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Messages_16px.png" >}} Messages: Register a new message and get an overview of your registered messages.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Actions_16px.png" >}} Actions: Actions you have to execute and overview of the executed actions. Not included in the standard version.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Questionnaires_16px.png" >}} Questionnaires: Checklists, risk analysis lists and survey forms you have to fill out. If you have answered an activity by clicking on a link in an email, you can open this page to modify your answer until the deadline for the activity expires.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Info_16px.png" >}} Info: Look at laws, rules, information and other documents that are relevant to your company.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Preferences_16px.png" >}} Preferences: Edit your user information.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Help_16px.png" >}} Help: See the documentation about the system. User manuals, guidelines and links to the change log for Qm+.

### Buttons

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Printer.png" >}} Print: Prints the current screen.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Help.png" >}} Help: Opens this page.

# Inbox
{{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Table_edit.png" >}} Inbox is a tab on the Main Page.

The inbox is used for following up cases you have to do something about.

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/User.png" >}} Cases I am responsible for shows cases that the logged in user has to work with.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/User.png" >}} All cases I have been involved in show all cases the user has worked with, including all the messages that the logged in user has registered, regardless of department.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Chart_organisation.png" >}} Department cases shows cases that the selected department is working with. Cases I am responsible for are not affected by the selected department in the Navigator, but the Department cases are.

Pink cases are messages, yellow cases are actions, blue-gray cases are hearings.

This page remembers the page number and sorting column when you visit another page and then return to it. The state is remembered for one hour or until the user presses the Log out button on the top row. It is also forgotten if the user opens another page that has a similar table.

### {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Info.png" >}} What can I do here?

- Here I can register a new message: Click on the yellow (green or red) button at the bottom of the page.
- I can handle cases that have been sent to me: Click on a case in the table.
- I can see cases that are being handled in other departments by selecting a department in the Navigator and then clicking on Department cases.

### Options

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Application_form_edit.png" >}} Register new message: Select a message form to register a new message. Opens the Edit message page. The message forms are displayed as individual buttons if there are up to 4 different forms. If there are more, the button {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Application_form_add.png" >}} Register new message must be pressed first. It opens a list of all active message forms.
- All cases drop-down menu: If you select a message form, only cases originating from such a form are shown. You can also select to see only the hearings.
- My current cases / All cases I have been involved in: When "My current cases" is selected, only cases that the logged in user should do something about are shown. When "All cases I have been involved in" is selected, the list shown below includes also the cases that the logged in user has done something about but they are not closed yet.

### Table

- When you click on a line of the main table, the selected case will open in its handling page. Messages open in the Message process page, actions open in the Action process page and hearings open in the Reply to a hearing page.
- Hold the cursor over the + symbol in the first column to get more information about a case.
- Change page: The buttons named First, Previous, Next, Last and any numbered buttons in between, are used to change the page when there are more than 20 cases that can be shown in the table.

### Icons

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Sort_down.png" >}} and {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/No_sort.png" >}} Sorting: The table is sorted by the column with the {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Sort_down.png" >}}. Click on the {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/No_sort.png" >}} to sort by that column.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Flag_green.png" >}}, {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Flag_yellow.png" >}}, {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Flag_red.png" >}} symbolize low, medium and high priority respectively.

### Tabs

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/User.png" >}} Cases I am responsible for: Displays the cases that the logged in user has to work with.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/User.png" >}} All cases I have been involved in: Displays the cases that the logged in user has worked with. Cases the user is only informed with are not included in this view.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Chart_organisation.png" >}} Department cases: Displays the cases that the users of the selected department have to work with.

# Admin
{{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Admin.png" >}} Admin is a tab on the Main Page.

Admin is used for managing the system. The access is controlled by the system role Admin. In the standard version, all the managers have full access to edit all information within their own organisation. For some customers this option is limited and therefore they will not get all the tabs that are described below. Contact your local super user if you feel that you need additional rights.

All information displayed / posted via Admin will relate to the selected department in the Navigator.

### {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Info.png" >}} What can I do here?

- As a Super user, I have access to the ADMIN-tab. This tab opens new tabs where I can make changes in the organisation (navigator), add users in the departments, change the categories that will be inserted in message forms, create forms, add new managing documents, etc.
- A click on each of the tabs under ADMIN provides access to new tabs.

### Buttons
