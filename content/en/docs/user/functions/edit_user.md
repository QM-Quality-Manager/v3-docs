### Fields

- User name: Used by the user for logging into the system. Distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters. Must be unique for each customer.
- Department / Type. This field defines the users access to the system.
  - Department: The department to which the user belongs.
    - If the department association is marked with {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Server_connect.png" >}}, the entry may not be deleted. But it is allowed to alter the department and user type. Only relevant for customers with AD / LDAP integration.
  - Type: The user's user type.
  - Substitute: The substitute function gives the option for a defined user to log into the system with the same access rights as the access one is substituting for. One substitute may be defined for each access a user has. For each access a user has:
    - If a substitute is defined, the name of the substitute is shown. Click on the name to edit or remove the substitute.
    - If no substitute is defined, a button to set the substitute is shown.
- Password: Used by the user for logging into the system. Distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Repeat password: Must be identical with the password field in order for the user's data to be saved.
- First name: The user's first name.
- Middle name: The user's middle name.
- Surname: The user's last name.
- Email address: The user's email address. Some functionality of the system is linked to the user's email address. It is therefore preferred that each user has a unique email address.
- Language: Selection of the display language for the user. Available languages in the system are: Norwegian (bokm√•l), Norwegian (nynorsk), English, Swedish and Danish (not translated framework for Danish). The available languages for each customer will vary.

- Comment: Free text field for additional information about the user.
