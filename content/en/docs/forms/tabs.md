# Roles submenu message form
{{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Group.png" >}} Roles submenu message form is a tab under Edit message form.

This page is used when you want to add restrictions for registering new messages or for seeing existing messages. To add a restriction, place a check mark for the desired role at the desired restriction type. There are two restriction types per role. For both cases, the system checks if that role is attached to the user himself or to his user type. If more than one roles are checked, it is sufficient to have one of them to fulfill the restriction. Message forms without roles have no restrictions and may be used normally.

### Restriction types

- New message. Hides the button to register a new message with this message form.
- See messages and charts. Hides messages registered with this message form in Reports, Inbox and Archive.

# Survey forms
Survey forms is a tab under {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page.png" >}} Forms.

Here you can manage the company's survey forms and alternative groups.

A survey form or questionnaire is a measuring instrument we use to measure the level differences between variables. Survey forms should be used only when we want to collect empirical data. That means surveys are based on a quantitative method. In order to make valid and reliable measurements it is required that we manage to construct a suervey form that creates a good communication process between the interviewer and the respondent. In a traditional survey it often pays to use the display type "show as single question".

- The ADMIN tab gives me the possibility to make changes in the organisation, the users, the forms, documents, roles and rules.
- My selection in the second tab row enables new tabs. A click on one of these produces table views that display the contents. Everything can be changed in the tables.
