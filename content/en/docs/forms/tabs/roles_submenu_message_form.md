This page is used when you want to add restrictions for registering new messages or for seeing existing messages. To add a restriction, place a check mark for the desired role at the desired restriction type. There are two restriction types per role. For both cases, the system checks if that role is attached to the user himself or to his user type. If more than one roles are checked, it is sufficient to have one of them to fulfill the restriction. Message forms without roles have no restrictions and may be used normally.

### Restriction types

- New message. Hides the button to register a new message with this message form.
- See messages and charts. Hides messages registered with this message form in Reports, Inbox and Archive.
