Here you can manage the company's risk analysis lists.

### {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Info.png" >}} What can I do here?

- The ADMIN tab gives me the possibility to make changes in existing Risk analysis lists. Click on the icon with the yellow pencil in the "Edit" column, or create a new list. Click on the button "New list" at the bottom of the page.
- RECOMMENDATION:
  - A. Create a list with the typical tasks that are performed in the department which you selected in the Navigator. Use a work group to edit the content (the tasks) that will be included in the list.
  - B. Send the list to those who need to answer it, i.e. assess the risk for each task: Click on ADMIN / Planning

### Buttons

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_add.png" >}} New list: Creates a new risk analysis list and takes you to the New list screen.

### Icons

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_gear.png" >}} Takes you to the Edit list information screen to edit the information on the selected risk analysis list.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_edit.png" >}} Takes you to the Edit list content screen to edit the questions of the selected risk analysis list.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page.png" >}} Opens the preview window to see how the list looks in the printer friendly version. In this window you can also choose to see the list in list form.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Turnarrow.gif" >}} Activates / Deactivates the form depending on whether you are under the tab Deactivated lists or Active lists respectively.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_copy.png" >}} Copy list: Creates a copy of the selected risk analysis list.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_delete.png" >}} Deletes the selected list. This icon appears only if the tab Deactivated lists is selected and if the risk analysis list has not been used in an activity.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_save.png" >}} Opens the page Export to the common library. If this icon is disabled / grayed out, the list is already in the common library.

### Tabs

- Active lists: Shows the active lists that are available in the department which is selected in the Navigator.
- Deactivated lists: Shows the deactivated lists that are available in the department which is selected in the Navigator.
