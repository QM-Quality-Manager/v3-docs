Here you can manage the company's message forms.

### {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Info.png" >}} What can I do here?

- As a super user I can create 4 different types of forms (lists): Checklists, Risk analysis lists, Message forms and Survey forms. Click on the button New form at the bottom of the page.
- I can edit the content of the existing forms: Click on the icon with the yellow pencil in the column Edit.
- I can import forms from the Common library. It contains forms that are made by other customers of Qm+ and can be used by all customers of Qm+.

### Buttons

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Application_form_add.png" >}} New form: Creates a new message form and takes you to the Edit message form screen.

### Icons

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Application_form_edit.png" >}} Takes you to the Edit message form screen to edit the contents of the selected message form.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Application_form.png" >}} Opens the printer friendly version of the form.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Turnarrow.gif" >}} Activates / Deactivates the form depending on whether you are under the tab Deactivated forms or Active forms respectively.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Application_form_delete.png" >}} Deletes the selected message form. This icon appears only if the tab Deactivated forms is selected and if the message form has not been used to register a message.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_save.png" >}} Opens the page Export to the common library. If this icon is disabled / grayed out, the form is already in the common library.

### Tabs

- Active forms: Shows the active message forms that are available for the department which is selected in the Navigator.
