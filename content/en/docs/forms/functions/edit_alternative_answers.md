Edit alternative answers is used for setting alternative answers and display criteria for questions in survey forms.

### {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Info.png" >}} What can I do here?

- I can add answer groups in the questionnaire. Click on the drop-down menu with the Alternative groups and select one.
- If the alternative group you are looking for is not in the drop-down menu: Click on "New alternative group" at the bottom of the page. You will find your new group at the bottom.
- I can select if the alternative answers will be Text, Multiple choice or Single choice. Click in Order / Answer type.

### Drop-down menu

- Default alternative group for this list: Drop-down menu that sets the alternative group which will be used in this list. The corresponding Choose button updates the list below according to the choice made here. Note that all changes of alternative answers you have already done in this list will be overwritten when you do this.

### List table

The table shows all the questions in the list and is used for assigning alternative groups to each question. Display criteria can also be set for all questions.

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Accept.png" >}} / {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Asterisk_orange.png" >}}: Opens the submenu to edit the display criteria for this question. {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Accept.png" >}} means that the question does not have a display criterion and will always be shown. {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Asterisk_orange.png" >}} means that the question has a display criterion and that it will only be shown for the user who answers the list when the display criterion is fulfilled.
- Group / Element name: Dark rows show groups, light rows show questions.
- Order / Answer type: Sorting applies to all questions in a group, answer type applies to each question.
- Alternative group: The alternative group that applies to the current question. If the alternative group is changed for a group and the Save button is used, all the questions in that group will be assigned to this alternative group.

### Alternative answers

This is the same table that can be found under Alternative groups.
