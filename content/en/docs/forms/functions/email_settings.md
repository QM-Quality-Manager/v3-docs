In this page you can change the subject of emails that are sent because of the Rules of the type Informed upon message registration. This means that in order to have any effect, this page must be used in combination with rules of this type. The email subject can be set to the name of a checked category in the message that belongs to a specified category group. If you do not set anything in this page, the default email subject will be used (e.g. "You have a new message in Qm+ from ...").

### Drop-down menus

- Category group: The defining or single-choice category group, the checked category of which will be set as the email subject.
- From department: The department from which this setting will apply.

Please note that if multiple category groups are set in this page, the category group with the From department which is closest to where the message was registered will be used.

### Buttons

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Delete.png" >}} Delete: Deletes the specified category group / From department combination.
