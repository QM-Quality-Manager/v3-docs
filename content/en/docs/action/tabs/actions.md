  Actions is a tab under Archive.

Shows all the actions registered on the department which is selected in the Navigator with the status that is selected in one of the underlying tabs. If the underlying tabs have one action for every status, an additional tab for search appears. When performing a search from Action search, the selected search criteria are shown in a separate table above the results table.

### Table

- By clicking on a line in the main table, the action will open in the Action process page.
- Hold the cursor over the + symbol in the first column to get more information about an action, including its history.

### Buttons

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page.png" >}} Expanded view / {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Table.png" >}} Table: Toggle between table and expanded view. The table gives a compact description of the actions intended for use when working with them. The expanded view gives a more complete description of the whole action, similar to the printer friendly (.pdf) version.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/LeftArrow.gif" >}} and {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/RightArrow.gif" >}} Change page: The arrows are used to change the page when there are more than 20 cases that can be displayed in the table.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Arrowopen.gif" >}} and {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Arrowclosed.gif" >}} Sorting: The table is sorted by the column with the {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Arrowopen.gif" >}}. Click on the {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Arrowclosed.gif" >}} to sort by another column.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_save.png" >}} Save as file: Allows you to download and save the page as an HTML file on your machine locally. The file can be edited in any application that can edit HTML, including Word.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_white_acrobat.png" >}} Show as pdf: Opens the Option page for reports, from which you can create a report with the related actions. This is intended for paper printing.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Printer.png" >}} Print: Prints the current screen.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Help.png" >}} Help: Opens this page.
