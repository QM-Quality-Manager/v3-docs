The Calendar screen shows an annual time chart of when the activities of the company should be executed. The activities are ordered by activity group and the time is given in week numbers. The current week number is marked with bold numbers. If an activity is active for at least one day in a given week, this week will be marked in the time chart. Activities that have not started are shown in blue, activities in progress are shown in orange, and finished ones are shown in green.
