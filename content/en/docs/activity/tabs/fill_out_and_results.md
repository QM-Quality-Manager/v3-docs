Fill out and results is used for responding to activities.

The page lists all the users that can participate in the selected activity. This is a tool for managers with which they can monitor who has completed an activity and do the registration for the users who have delivered their answer on paper.

The user list is adjusted according to the selected department in the Navigator, the choice of department in the drop-down menu below and the roles associated with the activity and the users.

The list is first sorted so that those who have completed the activity are at the bottom, then the table is sorted by user type.

### Drop-down menus

- Activity group:
  - Show all activities. All activities are shown in the Activity drop-down menu, regardless of the activity group.
  - List of all activity groups. If you select an activity group, only the activities of the selected activity group are shown in the Activity drop-down menu.
- Activity selection: Select the activity to be answered.
- Department selection:
  - This department: Only users in the department which is selected in the Navigator appear in the table.
  - This and subordinate departments: All users from the department which is selected in the Navigator or from its subordinate departments appear in the table.

### Graph

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Chart_bar.png" >}} The graph above the table shows the participation in the activity. This graph shows the results from the department which is selected in the Navigator and its subordinate departments, regardless of what is selected in the department drop-down menu. After the graph, for regular activities, the number of users who answered / the number of users who will participate in the activity is shown. For repetitive activities, the number of users who answered / the number of users who can participate / the total number of answers is shown.
