# Calendar
Tab under the Activity plan.

The Calendar screen shows an annual time chart of when the activities of the company should be executed. The activities are ordered by activity group and the time is given in week numbers. The current week number is marked with bold numbers. If an activity is active for at least one day in a given week, this week will be marked in the time chart. Activities that have not started are shown in blue, activities in progress are shown in orange, and finished ones are shown in green.

# Fill out and results
Tab under the Activity plan.

Fill out and results is used for responding to activities.

The page lists all the users that can participate in the selected activity. This is a tool for managers with which they can monitor who has completed an activity and do the registration for the users who have delivered their answer on paper.

The user list is adjusted according to the selected department in the Navigator, the choice of department in the drop-down menu below and the roles associated with the activity and the users.

The list is first sorted so that those who have completed the activity are at the bottom, then the table is sorted by user type.

### Drop-down menus

### Graph

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Chart_bar.png" >}} The graph above the table shows the participation in the activity. This graph shows the results from the department which is selected in the Navigator and its subordinate departments, regardless of what is selected in the department drop-down menu. After the graph, for regular activities, the number of users who answered / the number of users who will participate in the activity is shown. For repetitive activities, the number of users who answered / the number of users who can participate / the total number of answers is shown.
