# Common library
The Common library is a tab under Checklists, Risk analysis lists, Message forms and Survey forms.

Here you can see all the forms that have been added to the common library of the customers of Qm+, for the form type you are under. Used for exchanging forms. Documents are planned for a later version.

### Drop-down menus

- Form type. All forms that are uploaded to the common library can be marked with various keywords. Use this drop-down menu to see only those forms that are tagged with the selected keyword.

### Icons

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page.png" >}}Opens the preview window to see how the list looks in the printer friendly version. In this window you can also choose to see the list in list version and in single question view as it will look when it will be filled out.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_go.png" >}}Imports the current form into your Qm+ database. Please note that for message forms, all the category groups and categories in the form that do not already exist in your database will be created on the department you are when you click on this icon. This icon can be deactivated / grayed out. This means that the form already exists in your database.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_delete.png" >}}Deletes the current form. This icon appears only to the user who uploaded the form in the common library.
