Here you can manage the company's survey forms and alternative groups.

A survey form or questionnaire is a measuring instrument we use to measure the level differences between variables. Survey forms should be used only when we want to collect empirical data. That means surveys are based on a quantitative method. In order to make valid and reliable measurements it is required that we manage to construct a suervey form that creates a good communication process between the interviewer and the respondent. In a traditional survey it often pays to use the display type "show as single question".

### {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Info.png" >}} What can I do here?

- The ADMIN tab gives me the possibility to make changes in the organisation, the users, the forms, documents, roles and rules.
- My selection in the second tab row enables new tabs. A click on one of these produces table views that display the contents. Everything can be changed in the tables.
- The"Edit"-column on the right side of each table has two main functions: The black arrow deactivates, and the icons that have yellow in them give editing possibilities.

### Buttons

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page.png" >}} New list: Creates a new list and takes you to the New list page.

### Icons

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_gear.png" >}} Takes you to the Edit list information screen to change the information for the selected list.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_edit.png" >}} Takes you to the Edit list content screen to change the content of the selected list. It is only possible to edit survey forms that were created on the department which is selected in the Navigator.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_key.png" >}} Takes you to the Edit alternative answers screen to edit the content of the selected list. It is only possible to edit alternative answers in survey forms that were created on the department which is selected in the Navigator.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Turnarrow.gif" >}} Activates / Deactivates the selected survey form, depending on whether you are under Deactivated lists or Active lists respectively. It is only possible to change the status of survey forms that were created on the department which is selected in the Navigator.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_copy.png" >}} Copy list: Creates a copy of the selected survey form.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_delete.png" >}} Delete list: Deletes the selected survey form. This icon only comes up if the tab Deactivated lists is selected and the specific survey form is not attached to an activity. It is only possible to delete survey forms that were created on the department which is selected in the Navigator.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_save.png" >}} Opens the page Export to the common library. If this icon is disabled / grayed out, the list is already in the common library.
