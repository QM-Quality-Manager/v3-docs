  Function for filling out a list. 
---
This page is used when the display type single question view is selected and the list is opened from a link in an email sent out from Qm+. This means that all questions appear one by one with the comment field directly next to the question. When a question is answered, press "Next Question >>" to go to the next question.

### Fields

- The blue texts above the list are documents. Clicking on these opens a separate window with information that the person who has sent out the list thinks is relevant for those who should answer it.
- Checkboxes: Their appearance will vary depending on the list type. Check or make your choice for all the questions in the list that apply to you.
- Comment field: The title will vary depending on what was written by whoever created the list. For multiple choice questions there may be one comment field for each alternative answer.
- Hidden topics: In some cases, the person who has created the list has hidden some questions in some topics. This means that one must check the "Select" field after the name of the topic in order for the questions to appear. This is done so that it will be easy to skip questions that do not apply to the specific user.

### Buttons

- Next question >>: Displays the next question.
- << Previous question: Displays the previous question.
- Save: Saves the answer.
- Close: Closes this question without saving anything.
