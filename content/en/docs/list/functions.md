# Filling out a list form
Function for filling out a list. When the selected display type is the list version, or when the list is opened in order to be filled out when you are logged into Qm+ in the usual way, then the list opens in the list version view. This means that all questions are listed one after the other. There are no comment fields in the first page.

### Fields

- The blue texts above the list are documents. Clicking on these opens a separate window with information that the person who has sent out the list thinks is relevant for those who should answer it.
- Checkboxes: Their appearance will vary depending on the list type. Check or make your choice for all the questions in the list that apply to you.
- Version history: Shown for lists that have been answered. Drop-down menu that shows who answered the list and when it was done. Choose one of the options in the drop-down menu to see what the answer looked like at that time. Note that the Save button only appears when the latest version is selected.

### Buttons

### Fields

- The blue texts above the list are documents. Clicking on these opens a separate window with information that the person who has sent out the list thinks is relevant for those who should answer it.
