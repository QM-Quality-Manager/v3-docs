# Filling out a list form
Function for filling out a list. When the selected display type is the list version, or when the list is opened in order to be filled out when you are logged into Qm+ in the usual way, then the list opens in the list version view. This means that all questions are listed one after the other. There are no comment fields in the first page.

### Fields

- The blue texts above the list are documents. Clicking on these opens a separate window with information that the person who has sent out the list thinks is relevant for those who should answer it.
- Checkboxes: Their appearance will vary depending on the list type. Check or make your choice for all the questions in the list that apply to you.
- Version history: Shown for lists that have been answered. Drop-down menu that shows who answered the list and when it was done. Choose one of the options in the drop-down menu to see what the answer looked like at that time. Note that the Save button only appears when the latest version is selected.

### Buttons

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Tick.png" >}} Save: Saves the answer. If the list that you answer does not have any comment fields together with the questions, you will come to the page Do you have comments?. There you will have the opportunity to comment on all the questions you have checked in the list.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Cross.png" >}} Close: Exits the answer without saving.

# Filling out a list in single question view
Function for filling out a list. This page is used when the display type single question view is selected and the list is opened from a link in an email sent out from Qm+. This means that all questions appear one by one with the comment field directly next to the question. When a question is answered, press "Next Question >>" to go to the next question.

### Fields

- The blue texts above the list are documents. Clicking on these opens a separate window with information that the person who has sent out the list thinks is relevant for those who should answer it.
- Checkboxes: Their appearance will vary depending on the list type. Check or make your choice for all the questions in the list that apply to you.
- Comment field: The title will vary depending on what was written by whoever created the list. For multiple choice questions there may be one comment field for each alternative answer.
- Hidden topics: In some cases, the person who has created the list has hidden some questions in some topics. This means that one must check the "Select" field after the name of the topic in order for the questions to appear. This is done so that it will be easy to skip questions that do not apply to the specific user.

### Buttons

- Next question >>: Displays the next question.
- << Previous question: Displays the previous question.
- Save: Saves the answer.
- Close: Closes this question without saving anything.
