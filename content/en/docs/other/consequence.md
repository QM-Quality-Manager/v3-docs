 Consequence is the second component of a risk value.
---
To reduce the risk value one must initiate consequence-reducing measures.
- Example: Injury event. Possible consequence-reducing measures:
  - Use of helmets on the construction site.
  - First Aid kits.
  - Mandatory life vest when on a boat.

The scale of consequence in Qm+ is 1 - 5. The default values are:

**SET 1**
1) Insignificant damage
2) Light damage
3) Damage
4) Great damage
5) Widespread damage

Alternatively, customers can define their own texts. These sets are also available and can be used by setting the system preference RISKSCALE. Please note that the same set number will be used for both probability and consequence unless a different set number is defined for Consequence in the SPAN field.

**SET 2**
1) Safe
2) Dangerous
3) Critical
4) Very critical
5) Catastrophic

**SET 3**
1) Cat 1
2) Cat 2
3) Cat 3
4) Cat 4
5) Cat 5

**SET 4**
1) Insignificant damage
2) Light damage
3) Damage
4) Great damage
5) Widespread damage

**SET 5**
1) Negligible
2) Moderate
3) Significant
4) Severe
5) Catastrophic

**SET 6**
1) Insignificant damage
2) Light damage
3) Damage
4) Great damage
5) Widespread damage

**SET 7**
1) Little consequence
2) Middle consequence
3) Big consequence
4) Very big consequence
5) Catastrophic
