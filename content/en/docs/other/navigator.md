{{< onlystaticimg src="/images/NavigatorOpen.png" >}} An open navigator

To open the Navigator again, press the Navigator bar on the left side of the screen.

{{< onlystaticimg src="/images/NavigatorClosed.png" >}} A closed navigator

There is a system setting that defines if the Navigator should start open or closed upon login.

{{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Expand.png" >}} and {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Collapse.png" >}} are used to expand and collapse the organisation chart respectively. If you click on the name of a department, that department will be set as the selected department.

The selected department is used as the basis for what appears on the main screen to the right of the Navigator. There are two ways to see which is the selected department. In the Navigator that department gets a light blue background colour (Like "Teknisk etat" in the picture above) and in the main screen it is written next to the name of the logged in user.

There is a system setting that defines if the number of users per department will be displayed next to each department name.
