#### Exported file format

You have the possibility to choose the exported file format (.pdf / .docx / .doc / .odt / .xls) for message or action reports. Please note that the .pdf version is the most suitable for printing. At this point, we cannot guarantee that the .docx / .doc version will look the same in all editors or that the documents will open correctly with all versions of Microsoft Office (works best with MS Word 2010) and OpenOffice. This export format should only be used when there is a need for manually editing the report.
