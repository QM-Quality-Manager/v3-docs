Deactivated document groups do not appear under Info and no document can be assigned to them. Documents that belong to a deactivated document group do not appear under Info either.

### Buttons

- New document group: Opens the Edit document group screen to create a new document group.

### Icons

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Turnarrow.gif" >}}: Deactivates or activates the document group depending on whether you are under Document groups or under Deactivated document groups respectively.
