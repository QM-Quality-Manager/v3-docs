  Tab under Documents.

From here you can manage the company's documents.

The document names function as links. Click on a document name to open the document. Especially for documents created in Qm+: You can either open the HTML version by clicking on the document name, or you can get a PDF version of the document by clicking on the {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_white_acrobat.png" >}} icon on the right of the document name.

Deactivated documents do not appear under Info and cannot be attached to lists, message forms or activities. Already attached documents will still be shown there even if they are deactivated. Attached documents can not be deleted. Unpublished documents are not shown under Info either. If a document has both a published and a newer unpublished version, the published version will be displayed under Info.

### {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Info.png" >}} What can I do here?

- Create a new document click the button "New document" at the bottom of the page.
- Audit a document / send it out on a hearing: Click on the yellow "Edit document data"-icon on the right side of the table.
- In the next page you can select between the tabs Version overview, Hearing overview, Audit overview.

### Drop-down menus

- Department selection: The table shows either all the documents created at the department which is selected in the Navigator or the documents created at the department which is selected in the Navigator and those from its subordinate departments.
- Document tab selection: The table shows only the documents that belong to the selected document tab. If the option "Show documents from all document tabs" is selected, all the documents are shown independent of the document tab they belong to. Please note that only documents that belong to active document tabs are shown. The drop-down does not contain any deactivated document tabs either, but contains tabs from all departments.
- Document group selection: The table shows only the documents that belong to the selected document group. If the option "Show documents from all document groups" is selected, all the documents are shown independent of the document group they belong to. Please note that only documents that belong to active document groups are shown.
- Display mode:
  - Document Information. Default, shows an overview of where in the structure the document belongs.
  - Audit information. Displays the warning date for the next audit for the document and information about the previous / ongoing audit.

#### Edit

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Link_edit.png" >}}: Edit document data. Opens the Edit document data screen to edit an existing document.

This opens the New activity page under Activity plan and automatically sets the Activity group, the Activity name, the Attached list, the time period (From - To), the Activity distribution and the attached document. It is possible to use other lists than the default one for Read and understood. If someone wants to use another list as default, they will have to contact QmPlus AS. If you click the Create read and understood activity button of a document that has subdocuments, the subdocuments will also be added to the activity automatically.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Turnarrow.gif" >}}: Deactivate / Activate document. Deactivates or activates the document depending on whether you are under Documents or Deactivated documents respectively.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Link_delete.png" >}}: Delete document. Deletes the document. Only visible for deactivated documents that are not attached to other elements in the system.

#### Status

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_white_error.png" >}}: Not indexed.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_white_medal.png" >}}: Approved.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Tag_blue_edit.png" >}}: On hearing.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Tick.png" >}}: Ok.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Error.png" >}}: Indexing error. This may mean that the document is not available or is in a format that our indexing engine has not been able to decipher. It may happen that even normal formats like .pdf and .doc fail. If the link opens the document correctly, the error only means that the document will not appear in any search results if you do a free text search under Info. Links to intranet pages or other sites that the search engine has no access to, will always give indexing errors.
Note: The symbol ยง in a link is often not recognised by the search engine, which leads to an indexing error. We suggest replacing it with its equivalent HTML code, which is %C2%A7. 
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Exclamation.png" >}}: The document has a newer unpublished / existing published version.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Date.png" >}}: The document is part of a Read and understood activity. If you leave the cursor over the icon, you will see a popup with information about the last Read and understood activity for the document.
