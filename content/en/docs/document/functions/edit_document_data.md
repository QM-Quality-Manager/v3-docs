### {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Info.png" >}} What can I do here?

- As a super user / manager I can add new documents.
- I can choose whether the document will be retrieved from my own database: Click "Link", or from a file: CliCk "File".
- Or I can write a document in the internal editor. Click on the tab "Document content".

### Tabs

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Link_edit.png" >}} Document data: Used to edit the general information relating to a document. This is the first page you see when you create a new document.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_edit.png" >}} Document content: Shows only for internal documents (document type: "Write a document"). Used if you wish to write or edit a document directly in Qm+. The document is saved as an HTML document and has some formatting options. The text edit field uses TinyMCE.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Shape_align_center.png" >}} Process chart setup: Shows only when the document type "Process chart" is selected and the document has been saved at least once. Used to define the various fields in a process chart.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Group.png" >}} Role overview: Used to attach roles.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Folder_link.png" >}} Version overview: Shows the overview of all versions, with the document at the current time, when it was changed and who made the change.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Telephone_link.png" >}} Hearing / Approval: Used to create a new hearing and decide who will participate and approve it.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Date.png" >}} Read and understood: Shows an overview of the status of all Read and understood activities the document has had.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Page_code.png" >}} Audit overview: Shows an overview of all the audits the document has had.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Image_link.png" >}} Reference overview: Shows an overview of all the references for the document.

### Buttons

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Disc_multiple.png" >}} Create new version: Creates a new version of the document.
  - Example: If a document is in version 3.14 and you click on this button, it will change version to 4.1.
  - Should be used before making major changes to the document.
  - Shows only for documents that have been saved at least once.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Disc.png" >}} Save: Saves the changes made in the fields.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Cross.png" >}} Close: Takes you back to the page you came from.
