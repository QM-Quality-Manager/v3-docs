These are documents that are written directly into Qm+ using its document editing tool. Opens from the page Edit document data.

TinyMCE is used to create the text editor.

### Spell check

- If your browser has activated spell check, words that the spell checker considers to be misspelled will be highlighted.
- Press the Ctrl key at the same time as you right click on the highlighted word to get spelling suggestions.

### Editor buttons

The functions in this editor work in a similar way as in other document editing tools. Note in particular:

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Bullist.gif" >}} Bulleted (unordered) list: Select some text and click on this button to turn the text into a bulleted list. Click on the arrow to the right of the icon to select the bullet shape.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Numlist.gif" >}} Numbered (ordered) list: Select some text and click on this button to turn the text into a numbered list. Click on the arrow to the right of the icon to select the number type.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Outdent.gif" >}} Decrease indent (outdent): Allows you to remove a <tab> character or combine a sub-list with the rest of the list.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Indent.gif" >}} Increase indent: Allows you to add a <tab> character or to create a sub-list of items in a list. For a sub-list the numbering starts anew. One can have different types of numbering in the list and the sub-list. This can be set using the arrow to the right of the Numbered list or the Bulleted list icon.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Link.gif" >}} Insert / Edit link: Select some text and then click on this button to turn the text into a link. You will then see a dialogue box where the link address can be entered.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Unlink.gif" >}} Remove link (unlink): Select an existing link and then click on this button to turn the link into plain text.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Html.gif" >}} Edit HTML source code: Opens a separate window where the document's HTML code can be edited directly. This should be done only if you know HTML. Remember to click on the Update button when you are finished editing the HTML code. For explanation of the various HTML tags look here: Overview of HTML elements.
