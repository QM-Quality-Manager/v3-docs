# Goals
Goals is a tab under {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Info_16px.png" >}} Info.

Used in the standard version to display a textual description of the company's goals. There is a field for "Goals for quality management" and one for "Goals for HES". Users with the user type Manager who are registered on the highest department in the hierarchy have a Save button that allows them to change the content of these fields.

Goals are not multilingual and are the same for all departments. If such functionality is desired, use the normal mechanisms for documents (see Info). The tab Goals may be removed in the future. 

# Favourite documents

Favourite documents is a tab under {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Info_16px.png" >}} Info.

To be able to see this tab, a user must have the system tab role "Info_Favourite documents".
This page contains in an alphabetical order all the documents that the user has marked as Favourites in Info. When the cursor passes over a document, the "remove from favourites" icon {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Heart_delete.png" >}} appears. By clicking on it, the specific document is removed from this page.

# Managing documents
Managing documents is a tab under Info 16px.png Info.

Used in the standard version to show the documents. Can be changed / removed by the company's super user.
