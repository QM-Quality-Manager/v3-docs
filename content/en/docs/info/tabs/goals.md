  Goals is a tab under Info.
---
Used in the standard version to display a textual description of the company's goals. There is a field for "Goals for quality management" and one for "Goals for HES". Users with the user type Manager who are registered on the highest department in the hierarchy have a Save button that allows them to change the content of these fields.

Goals are not multilingual and are the same for all departments. If such functionality is desired, use the normal mechanisms for documents (see Info). The tab Goals may be removed in the future.
