# Favourite documents
To be able to see this tab, a user must have the system tab role "Info_Favourite documents".
This page contains in an alphabetical order all the documents that the user has marked as Favourites in Info. When the cursor passes over a document, the "remove from favourites" icon {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Heart_delete.png" >}} appears. By clicking on it, the specific document is removed from this page.
