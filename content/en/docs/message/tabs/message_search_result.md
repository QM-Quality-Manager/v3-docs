  Search is a tab under Messages/NC, Log, Risk and Comments.
---
This page displays the results when performing a message search and when someone has clicked on a message graph under Reports.

### Search criteria

Displays all the parameters that are used for the search.

- Drop-down menu Departments:
  - This department. Only messages registered on the selected department.
  - This and subordinate departments. Messages registered on the selected department and on its subordinate departments.
  - Subordinate departments. Only messages registered on the subordinate departments of the selected department.

Note that if the search criteria were set by clicking on a graph, the search can be based on a different department than the one selected in the Navigator. This department is shown in the field "Search from department" in the search criteria table. The Navigator can be used to change the selected department.

### Buttons

- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Find.png" >}} New search: Opens the search page for messages with all the search parameters cleared, except from the department which is selected in the Navigator and the selected message type.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Find.png" >}} Expand search: Opens the search page for messages with all parameters listed in the search criteria list set. You should use this button if you want to continue working with the current search and edit some of the search criteria.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Chart_bar.png" >}} Back to the graphs: Opens the Reports as they appeared in the previous page. The bar on which you has clicked to open this page is not added to the search criteria. This button appears only if you opened this page by clicking on a graph under Reports. When you click on a graph under Reports you perform a search for the messages that were represented by the bar you clicked on.
- {{< onlystaticimg src="/images/Chart_bar.png" >}} Show in graphs: Opens the Reports with the messages in the table below as the starting point. The bar on which you has clicked to open this page is added to the search criteria.

Use of the table is explained in Messages/NC, Log, Risk and Comments, depending on which tab you are under.
