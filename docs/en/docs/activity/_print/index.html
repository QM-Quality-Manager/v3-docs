<ul>
<li>Heading: The name of the activity.</li>
<li>Subject: The subject field in the email that will be sent out.</li>
<li>Text field: Here you can write the text to be included in the email. The text &ldquo;<a href="http://www.qmplus.com/Resultat%22">http://www.qmplus.com/Resultat&quot;</a> can be placed anywhere in the email, and will be replaced with an individual link for each recipient. This link will then be used to display the graph for the activity.</li>
<li>&ldquo;From&rdquo; address: This email address will appear in the sender field (From:). It is automatically set to the registered email address of the user who writes the email. This address will also receive any error messages about invalid email addresses. Email addresses can be changed in the Edit user information under Admin / Users.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="buttons-2">Buttons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Select all: Checks all the users in the list that have a seemingly valid email address.</li>

<li>Send result: Sends the results to all the users that are selected in the user list. If there are many (&gt; 100) users in the list, it may take some time before all emails are sent out. It is possible to close the Send results window while emails are being sent. When all the emails have been sent, you will get a message if you have not closed the Send results window. That does not necessarily mean that everyone has received their email. Sometimes emails take longer time to be delivered than you expect. Also remember to look in your own email inbox for messages about invalid email addresses. These addresses must be corrected before you can send the email to them again.</li>
<li>Use selected former message: Appears only for activities for which results emails have been sent earlier. Retrieves the subject and text of the selected former email so that it can be reused.

<li>Shown as percentage: The graph shows the result as a percentage of the total number of answers for each question. If &ldquo;Distributed on this and subdepartments&rdquo; is selected, there is a percentage for the selected department and a percentage for the subordinate departments.
<ul>
<li>For survey forms, the percentage is calculated for each alternative answer based on how many people have answered every single question.</li>
<li>For checklists the percentage is calculated based on all who have answered the list. Blank answers are also included here.</li>

<ul>
<li>Count: The total risk matrix at the top displays the number of answers to the questions in the list that fall within each risk area. Additionally, each question in the list gets its own risk matrix that shows the distribution of the answers to that question. To the right of each risk matrix is a table that shows the distribution of answers to that question within each risk group (red, yellow, green). The Count view is shown by default when you first open this page.</li>
<li>Average: The total risk matrix at the top displays the number of questions where the average value of the answers gives the specific risk value.

<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p>You have many possibilities to create actions for an activity from this page.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the Comments to the activity by clicking on a question, the title of the activity or the title of the list. This will attach the action to the comment messages that appear in this page. If there aren&rsquo;t any comment messages, the action will still be attached to the question or the list depending on where you clicked.</li>
<li>Open the Users that have answered the element by clicking on a graph. You can do this if you want to create a action for those who have given a specific answer to a question.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which page you will go to, affects what the action will be attached to. So what is right depends on whether you want it to be common to the whole list, attached to a single question or to an alternative answer.</p>

 Send reminder is a function under the 

  <img src="https://docs3.qmplus.com/images/Calendar.png"  width="" />


 Activity plan. Opens from Follow up and Activities.</p>
<p>Used for notifying those who will perform an activity. The reminder is sent by an email containing a link that opens the list which is attached to the activity. The list of possible recipients includes all participants in the activity who have not yet answered it.</p>
<h3 id="fields-6">Fields</h3>
<ul>
<li>Heading: The name of the activity.</li>
<li>Subject: The subject field in the email that will be sent out.</li>
<li>Text field: Here you can write the text to be included in the email. The text &ldquo;<a href="http://www.qmplus.net/Link%22">http://www.qmplus.net/Link&quot;</a> can be placed anywhere in the email, and will be replaced with an individual link for each recipient. This link will then be used to answer the activity for each user. If several users answer the same activity by using the same link only the last reply will be registered, unless the activity is registered as a repetitive activity. It is therefore important that such emails are not forwarded.</li>
<li>&ldquo;From&rdquo; address: This email address will show in the sender field (From:) of the email. It is automatically set to the registered email address of the user who writes the reminder. This address will also receive any error messages about invalid email addresses. Email addresses can be changed from the Edit user information under Admin / Users.</li>
<li>Former reminders sent for this activity: If any reminders had been sent earlier for this activity they will be listed here. If you want to use the same text as in a previous reminder, check the appropriate box in the Select column and then click on the Use selected former message button.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="user-list">User list</h3>
<ul>
<li>The list includes all the users who will participate in the activity and have not already answered it. The list is sorted by name.</li>
<li>At the top there is a summary of how many users are in the list and how many of them have a seemingly valid email address.</li>
<li>Send to: Check boxes for those who will receive the reminder. All the users in the list who have a seemingly valid email address are preselected.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="buttons-7">Buttons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Select all: Checks all the users in the list that have a seemingly valid email address.</li>
<li>Select none: Removes all checks in the user list. May be useful if you want to send a test reminder to yourself or send the email to a small sample before sending it out to everyone.</li>
<li>Send reminder: Sends the reminder to all the users that are selected in the user list. If there are many (&gt; 100) users in the list, it may take some time before all emails are sent out. It is possible to close the Send reminder window while emails are being sent. When all the emails have been sent, you will get a message if you have not closed the Send reminder window. That does not necessarily mean that everyone has received their email. Sometimes emails take longer time to be delivered than you expect. Also remember to look in your own email inbox for messages about invalid email addresses. These addresses must be corrected before you can send the reminder to them again.</li>
<li>Use the text from the selected former reminder: Appears only for activities for which email reminders have been sent earlier. Retrieves the subject and text of the selected former reminder so that it can be reused. You can make changes to the former text before sending the message. When you are finished, you have to click on the Send reminder button as usual.</li>
