<li>Risk analysis lists have a total risk matrix over the list of questions. An additional drop-down menu &ldquo;Show graph&rdquo; controls if the page displays the Count or the Average view.
<ul>
<li>Count: The total risk matrix at the top displays the number of answers to the questions in the list that fall within each risk area. Additionally, each question in the list gets its own risk matrix that shows the distribution of the answers to that question. To the right of each risk matrix is a table that shows the distribution of answers to that question within each risk group (red, yellow, green). The Count view is shown by default when you first open this page.</li>
<li>Average: The total risk matrix at the top displays the number of questions where the average value of the answers gives the specific risk value. For each question you get two charts displaying the average risk value of all answers to the question in the selected department in the Navigator (blue) and the average risk value of all answers to the question in the departments subordinate to the selected department in the Navigator (orange).</li>

<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p>You have many possibilities to create actions for an activity from this page.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the Comments to the activity by clicking on a question, the title of the activity or the title of the list. This will attach the action to the comment messages that appear in this page. If there aren&rsquo;t any comment messages, the action will still be attached to the question or the list depending on where you clicked.</li>
<li>Open the Users that have answered the element by clicking on a graph. You can do this if you want to create a action for those who have given a specific answer to a question.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which page you will go to, affects what the action will be attached to. So what is right depends on whether you want it to be common to the whole list, attached to a single question or to an alternative answer.</p>

<ul>
<li>Heading: The name of the activity.</li>

The text &ldquo;<a href="http://www.qmplus.net/Link%22">http://www.qmplus.net/Link&quot;</a> can be placed anywhere in the email, and will be replaced with an individual link for each recipient. This link will then be used to answer the activity for each user. If several users answer the same activity by using the same link only the last reply will be registered, unless the activity is registered as a repetitive activity. It is therefore important that such emails are not forwarded.</li>
<li>&ldquo;From&rdquo; address: This email address will show in the sender field (From:) of the email. It is automatically set to the registered email address of the user who writes the reminder. This address will also receive any error messages about invalid email addresses. Email addresses can be changed from the Edit user information under Admin / Users.</li>
<li>Former reminders sent for this activity: If any reminders had been sent earlier for this activity they will be listed here. If you want to use the same text as in a previous reminder, check the appropriate box in the Select column and then click on the Use selected former message button.</li>

<li>Send reminder: Sends the reminder to all the users that are selected in the user list. If there are many (&gt; 100) users in the list, it may take some time before all emails are sent out. It is possible to close the Send reminder window while emails are being sent. When all the emails have been sent, you will get a message if you have not closed the Send reminder window. That does not necessarily mean that everyone has received their email. Sometimes emails take longer time to be delivered than you expect. Also remember to look in your own email inbox for messages about invalid email addresses. These addresses must be corrected before you can send the reminder to them again.</li>
<li>Use the text from the selected former reminder: Appears only for activities for which email reminders have been sent earlier. Retrieves the subject and text of the selected former reminder so that it can be reused. You can make changes to the former text before sending the message.

    <div class="lead">Function under Activity plan / Graphs for the list.</div>
	<p>Used for sending the results from an activity to users who normally do not have access to them. Results are sent by an email containing a link that opens the graph for the activity.</p>
<h3 id="fields">Fields</h3>
<ul>
<li>Heading: The name of the activity.</li>
<li>Subject: The subject field in the email that will be sent out.</li>
<li>Text field: Here you can write the text to be included in the email. The text &ldquo;<a href="http://www.qmplus.com/Resultat%22">http://www.qmplus.com/Resultat&quot;</a> can be placed anywhere in the email, and will be replaced with an individual link for each recipient. This link will then be used to display the graph for the activity.</li>
<li>&ldquo;From&rdquo; address: This email address will appear in the sender field (From:). It is automatically set to the registered email address of the user who writes the email. This address will also receive any error messages about invalid email addresses. Email addresses can be changed in the Edit user information under Admin / Users.</li>
<li>Former result messages sent for this activity: If any results emails had been sent earlier for this activity they will be listed here. If you want to use the same text as in a previous email, check the appropriate box in the Select column and then click on the Use selected former message button.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="send-results-to">Send results to</h3>
<p>Used to create a list of possible recipients.</p>
<ul>
<li>Department: Since the result that is sent out is a graph for the department which is selected in the Navigator, one can choose here the department for the users who will receive the results.</li>
<li>Send results to those who have answered: Displays all the users who have answered the activity.</li>
<li>Send results to those who could answer: Displays all the users who could answer the activity.</li>
<li>Send results to those who have certain roles: Opens a new panel where you can select a set of roles. All the users who have at least one of the selected roles will be displayed.</li>
<li>Choose from all users: Provides the opportunity to choose among all the users from the selected department and from its subordinate departments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Select one of the 4 options above and click on the &ldquo;Select&rdquo; button.</p>
<ul>
<li>At the top there is a summary of how many users are in the list and how many of them have a seemingly valid email address.</li>
<li>Send to: Check boxes for those who will receive the email. All the users in the list that have a seemingly valid email address are preselected.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="buttons">Buttons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Select all: Checks all the users in the list that have a seemingly valid email address.</li>
<li>Select none: Removes all checks in the user list. May be useful if for example you want to send a test email to yourself or send it to a small sample before sending it out to everyone.</li>
<li>Send result: Sends the results to all the users that are selected in the user list. If there are many (&gt; 100) users in the list, it may take some time before all emails are sent out. It is possible to close the Send results window while emails are being sent. When all the emails have been sent, you will get a message if you have not closed the Send results window. That does not necessarily mean that everyone has received their email. Sometimes emails take longer time to be delivered than you expect. Also remember to look in your own email inbox for messages about invalid email addresses. These addresses must be corrected before you can send the email to them again.</li>
<li>Use selected former message: Appears only for activities for which results emails have been sent earlier. Retrieves the subject and text of the selected former email so that it can be reused. You can make changes to the former text before sending the message. When you are finished, you have to click on the Send result button as usual.</li>
</ul>
