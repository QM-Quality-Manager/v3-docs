        &lt;p&gt;An activity without an attached list gets no graph, but can still be used to measure participation for example in a meeting or similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;data&#34;&gt;Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activity group: Under which activity group this activity will be placed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activity name: The name used to identify the activity wherever it is used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attached list: The list attached to this activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From: The date and time when the activity starts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To: The date and time when the activity ends. Note: A day begins at 00:00 and ends at 23:59.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show for the language: An activity can be active in multiple languages simultaneously. You must write a name for each language you wish it to have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The subordinate departments will do the activity: Check this box if the subdepartments of the selected department will participate in the activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How often will the activity be performed?: One time is usually selected. Repeating is used if the activity is to be filled out an unlimited number of times by each participant. Periodic is used if the activity will be performed in fixed periods, for example weekly. For the periodic activities the From and To fields must include the entire period, e.g. the whole year if you want to plan weekly activities for a whole year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you want an email reminder before the activity is due?: Sends an email to the person who created the activity at a certain number of days before it ends. The email contains the expected participation and a link to the Follow up page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This activity is answered anonymously: Checkbox that makes the activity anonymous. Comments on anonymous activities will be anonymous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of answers before the result is viewable: Appears only when the anonymity box is checked. The number given here controls how many answers a single department must have before a graph is shown for this department. If too few answers have been given, the sum graph for the department above this in the hierarchy must be used to get a result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display as list / Display as series of single questions (reminder link only) / Display as control list: Determines the display type of the list. Click on the 

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://docs3.qmplus.com/images/Page.png&#34;  width=&#34;&#34; /&gt;


 icon to see how the selected list looks like in this display type. Only survey forms should use the option &amp;ldquo;Display as series of single questions&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Reminder link only&amp;rdquo; means that this display type will only be used when the person who will answer the list has come to it by clicking on the link in the email that is sent out as a reminder for the activity. In the control list display view, there is one checkbox per day per question and the alternative answers do not appear at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activity distribution: Normal or Audit. &amp;ldquo;Audit&amp;rdquo; allows the activity to be answered once for each department the participants have access to. Used as a rule, if you go an inspection round or audit that will be performed by the same user in several places. This option is not included in the standard version. If you want this option enabled, contact &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:drift@qmplus.com&#34;&gt;drift@qmplus.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roles that will perform the activity: When you associate roles to an activity, only users that have at least one of these roles can participate in it. Only these will be included in the activity&amp;rsquo;s participation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add documents to the activity: Documents attached to the activity will be shown at the top of the list below the heading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;access-control&#34;&gt;Access control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-different-access-types-give-these-privileges&#34;&gt;The different access types give these privileges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read access&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can read the contents of a filled out activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write access&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can fill out or modify the contents of a filled out activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;requirements-for-the-different-access-types&#34;&gt;Requirements for the different access types&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read access
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employees have read access to all their own activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managers, case handlers and reviewers have read access to all the activities within their remit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write access
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employees and reviewers have write access to all their own activities within the period they can be filled out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managers and case handlers have write access to all the activities within their remit and within the period they can be filled out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Super users with the system role Content administrator have write access to all the activities within their remit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
