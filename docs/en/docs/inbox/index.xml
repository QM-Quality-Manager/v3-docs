  &lt;img src=&#34;https://docs3.qmplus.com/images/Info.png&#34;  width=&#34;&#34; /&gt;


 What can I do here?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here I can handle a case. Click: Choose action in the yellow / orange panel, or&amp;hellip;..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can simply &amp;ldquo;Send a note about the case&amp;rdquo;. Click on the white checkbox and write in the textfield that appears. This is sent by e-mail!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can also edit the message contents: Click on the tab &amp;ldquo;Edit message&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;message-details&#34;&gt;Message details&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;choose-action&#34;&gt;Choose action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drop-down menu with a coloured background that means that this is where you need to do something if you come to this page. Whatever choice you make in this drop-down menu, you will be able to check off the &amp;ldquo;Send a note about the case&amp;rdquo; that makes the dialog boxes appear and gives you the possibility to send an email to those involved in the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible actions: Click Save / Send after you have selected an action in order for it to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose case handler: Used when you want to transfer the responsibility for the message to someone else, or set a deadline for the message. Note that it is up to the receiver of the message whether (s)he will create an action or (s)he will reject it. Those you can send the message to are those who have the user type manager or case handler on your own department, the department above it in the hierarchy or one of the departments under your own. You can also send the message to those who are set up under the tab Rules with the rule type &amp;ldquo;Additional case handlers&amp;rdquo; with a remit that includes your department. Please note that for messages that are created with message forms which have a role with the &amp;ldquo;See messages&amp;rdquo; limitation, those who do not satisfy that limitation will be taken off this list. You can set a deadline for when the person you send it to should have done something about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to former case handler: Used when you want to transfer the responsibility for the message back to someone who had it before. This option is only shown when a message has changed case handler at least once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reject: Used when a message will not be followed up further. This may be a test message, or duplicate or similar. This option should not be used for real messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register done action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close the case. Used when a small action that does not require further action is about to be executed or has already been executed. You get the opportunity to register who has executed the action and write a name and a description of the work that was done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan an action: Opens all the fields for the planning phase of the action.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give the action a name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a description of the work that will be performed. This must contain enough information, so that the person who will be assigned to the job will know what to do. You can also give an extended description of what can be done to prevent the incident from happening again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose who will perform the action in the field &amp;ldquo;Choose the persons that will do the job&amp;rdquo;. If you need people from other departments, use the department selection drop-down menu above the two fields that show the users. To add users, select them in the right panel and press the &amp;laquo; button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the deadline (&amp;ldquo;Must be finished before&amp;rdquo;) if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send email to those who are responsible for the execution if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Save / Send. This will create the action. A link to the new action appears in a table at the top of the page. Click on it or on the tab Action process if you wish to see the complete action details.&lt;/li&gt;

This creates an action in Qm+ that is attached to an action in Facilit. The text and the categories from the original deviation are also sent to the action in Facilit. When the action in Facilit changes status, the status of the action in Qm+ is updated also. No other information from Facilit appears in the action in Qm+ other than the status change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an option there, where, on a customer basis, one can choose if an action that is reported to be completed in Facilit should get the status Under approval (default) or Approved. An action that gets the status Under approval in Qm+ must be approved manually in Qm+ by the person who sent the case to Facilit in order to close it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each customer has the option to remove all options from this drop-down menu except from &amp;ldquo;Close the case&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Reject&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
