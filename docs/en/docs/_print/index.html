<li>Under planning: All actions start with this status. In this phase, the action is being planned. First give a name to the action so that it becomes easy to identify it later, and enter the budget if you use this field. The text fields Corrective action and How to prevent repetition must be filled out so that those who will execute the action will know what to do. The action categories may also be selected now. The last thing is to select those who should execute the action and give them a deadline. This is done in the mandatory panel Persons responsible. Click on Send to execution &raquo; or the &raquo; button in the Status panel to save the action and change its status to Under execution.</li>
<li>Under execution: In this phase, the work described in the action will be executed. Then those who carried out the action must tick the Executed box. They can also write a comment in the Comment field and fill in the Actual cost if they know it. When all the changes have been done, use the button Send to approval &raquo; or the &raquo; button in the Status panel. This saves the action and changes its status to Under approval.</li>

<ul>
<li>Department selection:
<ul>
<li>Distributed on this and subdepartments: A blue graph will be shown for the results from the department which is selected in the Navigator and an orange graph for the sum of the results from the departments under the selected department in the hierarchy.</li>

<ul>
<li>For survey forms, the percentage is calculated for each alternative answer based on how many people have answered every single question.</li>
<li>For checklists the percentage is calculated based on all who have answered the list. Blank answers are also included here.</li>

</li>
<li>Shown as mean value: Shows the average values for the answers.

<h3 id="graph">Graph</h3>
<p>The appearance of the graph depends on the list type.</p>
<ul>
<li>Checklists have one graph per question.</li>
<li>Risk analysis lists have a total risk matrix over the list of questions. An additional drop-down menu &ldquo;Show graph&rdquo; controls if the page displays the Count or the Average view.
<ul>
<li>Count: The total risk matrix at the top displays the number of answers to the questions in the list that fall within each risk area. Additionally, each question in the list gets its own risk matrix that shows the distribution of the answers to that question. To the right of each risk matrix is a table that shows the distribution of answers to that question within each risk group (red, yellow, green). The Count view is shown by default when you first open this page.</li>
<li>Average: The total risk matrix at the top displays the number of questions where the average value of the answers gives the specific risk value. For each question you get two charts displaying the average risk value of all answers to the question in the selected department in the Navigator (blue) and the average risk value of all answers to the question in the departments subordinate to the selected department in the Navigator (orange).</li>

<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p>You have many possibilities to create actions for an activity from this page.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the Comments to the activity by clicking on a question, the title of the activity or the title of the list. This will attach the action to the comment messages that appear in this page. If there aren&rsquo;t any comment messages, the action will still be attached to the question or the list depending on where you clicked.</li>
<li>Open the Users that have answered the element by clicking on a graph. You can do this if you want to create a action for those who have given a specific answer to a question.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which page you will go to, affects what the action will be attached to. So what is right depends on whether you want it to be common to the whole list, attached to a single question or to an alternative answer.</p>

    <div class="lead">Rules is a tab under Admin.</div>
	<p>Here you can manage various rules. Rules are used for setting up criteria, that when satisfied, a predefined &ldquo;reaction&rdquo; happens. Rule types (&ldquo;reactions&rdquo;) can only be defined by QmPlus AS.</p>
<p>At the moment, such criteria can be specific users, forms, categories, departments and notification types.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example 1: User A is an additional case handler for the HES-form and the Information security form, from the departments Technical, Culture and Administration.</li>
<li>Example 2: Users B and C will receive an email whenever a message is registered using the HES-form, has the category Fire safety selected and has been registered on the Technical department.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the current version, rules can only be created or modified by users with a user type that has the system role content administrator or rule administrator.</p>
<p>Please note that deactivated users, departments, forms or categories are marked with &ldquo;DEAKTIVATED&rdquo;. These rules will obviously not be valid. They are not automatically deleted though, in case the deactivated users or departments need to be replaced with another. The users responsible for creating rules should go through them occasionally for some clean-up.</p>
<h3 id="rule-types-reactions">Rule types (Reactions)</h3>
<p>In the current version, there are 8 different predefined Rule types:</p>
<h4 id="additional-case-handlers">Additional case handlers</h4>
<p>Here you can manage who should appear as an additional case handler when the &ldquo;Choose case handler&rdquo; function is used in the Message process page.</p>


  <img src="https://docs3.qmplus.com/images/ChooseCaseHandler.png"  width="" />



<p>Additional case handlers are added to the drop-down menu with the potential recipients when the option &ldquo;Send to case handler&rdquo; is selected as action on the Message process page (see image above).</p>
<p>The drop-down menu automatically contains all users with the system role Default possible message receiver. In the standard version user type manager and case handler from the following places:</p>
<ul>
<li>The department which is selected in the navigator.</li>
<li>The department directly above the department which is selected in the navigator.</li>
<li>All departments directly beneath the department which is selected in the navigator.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is used when users should be able to send messages without following the traditional hierarchy structure, for example across the organisation or directly to the responsible person in an entirely different part of the organisation.</p>
<p>If the option for Automatic early case processing is activated, Additional case handlers will also be included in the drop-down menu for selecting the case handler in the Register new message page.</p>
<p>The list shows all users who have been registered as additional case handlers in the whole company. In the column &ldquo;From department&rdquo; of the table you can see from which department a case handler was set.</p>
<p>Do not set additional case handlers unless you are absolutely sure of what you are doing. If in doubt, please contact QmPlus AS for clarifications.</p>
<h4 id="early-case-handlers">Early case handlers</h4>
<p>Here you can set up users who should be the default case handlers for one or more message forms.</p>
<p>ATTENTION: The rules for Early case handlers are intended to handle exceptions. If you want all messages to be sent to the nearest manager as a general rule, order the option for Automatic early case processing.</p>


  <img src="https://docs3.qmplus.com/images/EarlyCaseHandlers.png"  width="" />



<p>The field that shows that a message form is set up with &ldquo;Early case handling&rdquo; (and Irene Bauer as default case handler in the example above) is titled &ldquo;Send to case handler&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;From department&rdquo; drop-down menu, select from which department (inclusive) the default case handler function will apply. If several users are set as the default case handler on various departments for the same message form, the user whose department is the closest to the department which was selected in the navigator when the message was registered will be preselected in the &ldquo;From department&rdquo; drop-down menu in the message form. If priority or categories are added to this rule (based on the system setting EARLYCASEPROCESS) then the available case handlers will be updated after every change in the Edit message page during message registration.</p>
<p>A common way to use this is when you have a message form that for example should always go to a specified recipient, no matter where in the organisation the message is registered.</p>
<p>Please note that that when a message gets a case handler this way, when it is registered it will get the status &ldquo;Sent to case handler&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;New message&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For forms that have Early case handler rules defined, the Additional case handlers will never be included in the related drop-down of the Register new message page. If the option for Automatic early case processing is turned on, the defined rules with the early case handlers will override the automatic ones. If you do not want to override them but add them, use the Additional case handler rules as described in the previous section.</p>
<h4 id="action-approvers">Action approvers</h4>
<p>In principle, all users with a user type that contains the system role Process message (Manager or Case handler in the standard version) can handle all messages within their area of responsibility. To restrict who can close certain messages, you can set up Rules for that. These rules affect the following actions in the Message process page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reject</li>
<li>Close the case.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Action process page, rules can restrict the action:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approve action.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="informed-upon-message-registration">Informed upon message registration</h4>
<p>When a new message is registered, users who satisfy the criteria set up in one of these rules will receive a notification for the new message. The comment column can be used for personalising the notification text. The notification may be sent by email, SMS or both. The default type is Email. The other two options (Sms, Email and sms) will only be available for customers who have the SMS functionality enabled. The email notification will have the default subject &ldquo;You have a new message in Qm+ from&hellip;&rdquo; unless a special setting has been added from the Email settings page for the message form that is specified in this rule.</p>
<h4 id="informed-upon-message-closure">Informed upon message closure</h4>
<p>When a message is closed, users who satisfy the criteria set up in one of these rules will receive a notification. The comment column can be used for personalising the notification text. The notification may be sent by email, SMS or both. The default type is Email. The other two options (Sms, Email and sms) will only be available for customers who have the SMS functionality enabled. The email notification will have the default subject &ldquo;Message closed in Qm+&hellip;&rdquo; unless a special setting has been added from the Email settings page for the message form that is specified in this rule. A message is defined as closed when it only relates to approved actions or it is rejected.</p>
<h4 id="informed-upon-threshold-violation">Informed upon threshold violation</h4>
<ul>
<li>When a threshold value has been exceeded, a warning email is sent to the users specified in the rule.</li>
<li>The warning emails are sent when running the night job, in the same way as warnings for passed due date.</li>
<li>One can choose between Periodic warning and Daily warning for various time frames.
<ul>
<li>A Periodic warning sends an email once, after the threshold is breached.
<ul>
<li>If a rule is modified and more users get added as recipients of the warning, after the periodic warning has been sent or if the sending of the email to one of the specified users fails, then the warning will be sent again at the next opportunity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Daily warnings are sent for as long as the threshold is exceeded for the selected time frame.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The threshold value is referring only to the number of registered messages.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="configuration-for-dynamic-graphs">Configuration for dynamic graphs</h4>
<p>Used for defining which values will be used on the Y-axis and X-axis for the dynamic graphs in the Reports page. The dynamic graphs are shown when you select the box Dynamic graphs, see image below.</p>


  <img src="https://docs3.qmplus.com/images/DynamicGraphs.png"  width="" />



<p>If no rules have been defined here, there will be no Dynamic graphs on the Reports page. Rules of this type are made one row at a time. The save symbol becomes visible once you add a new rule or you change an existing one.</p>
<h4 id="configuration-for-calculation-reports">Configuration for calculation reports</h4>
<p>This rule type can be used to define a calculation that can be displayed under the report type Calculation reports in the Reports page. Please contact us if there is a need for such calculations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Calculation of the H-value = (number of personal injuries * 1000000) / Total number of hours spent.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to use the calculation above, messages with the category for personal injuries must be registered in Qm+. Periodically, the total number of hours must be registered. In order for the results to make sense, the periodic registration of hours must also match with the period used to display the calculation reports.</p>
<h4 id="filter-rules">Filter rules</h4>
<p>These are rules that can be used as part of a rule for calculation reports to create the restriction expressions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: You wish to include only one category from messages with a specific message form with a given priority and also the categories from another form with another priority. Then you can create two different filters here and then combine them in their respective categories in the calculation rule.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="columns">Columns</h3>
<ul>
<li>Name: The name of the user to whom this rule applies.
<ul>
<li>For some rule types, you can select between any of the users of the company, regardless of user type. For others, the user type must have certain access rights to appear in the user list. For example, in order to appear in the list of available &ldquo;Early case handlers&rdquo;, a user needs to have the right to handle a message.</li>
<li>Without a user name the rule will have no effect anywhere in the system. Mandatory field for all Rule types.</li>
<li>You can have multiple user names in one rule, which would then apply to all the selected users.</li>

	<p>In Qm+, the term audit means control of the quality system and is used for the process of reviewing and approving one or more documents. This applies both to reviewing the document content and the status.</p>
<p>Example: You read the document that describes a routine. Does the routine correspond to reality?</p>

<li>If no, then you have to either change the practice of the company, or the document&rsquo;s content must be rewritten so that the description corresponds to reality.</li>

: Indexing error. This may mean that the document is not available or is in a format that our indexing engine has not been able to decipher. It may happen that even normal formats like .pdf and .doc fail. If the link opens the document correctly, the error only means that the document will not appear in any search results if you do a free text search under Info. Links to intranet pages or other sites that the search engine has no access to, will always give indexing errors.
Note: The symbol Â§ in a link is often not recognised by the search engine, which leads to an indexing error. We suggest replacing it with its equivalent HTML code, which is %C2%A7.</li>

    <div class="lead">Process chart setup: Used for editing the contents of a document of the type &ldquo;Process chart&rdquo;.</div>
	<p>Opens from the page Edit document data and shows only when the document type &ldquo;Process chart&rdquo; is selected and the document has been saved at least once.</p>
<p>This page is separated in two parts. The left part is the Tree structure of the process while the right one depends on what is selected in the left part. Please note that you can right click on the tree for more options.</p>
<h3 id="general">General</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new process initially has the same name as the document it contains it, but you can change it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can make a process chart in all the languages available in the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In general, a process can contain steps (which have to be implemented in a certain order) or tasks (which do not have to be implemented in an order, they could also be done in parallel), but not both at the same level. By default, a new process contains 4 main steps. In the process chart Preview page, steps are depicted in yellow while tasks are depicted in light blue. We will use the general term phase for both steps and tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each step or task can have one or more responsible parties, which can be of type Object (User, Role, User type, Department) or Text (free text field with a limited size).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each step or task can have attributes (even if it is also a process with subprocesses). Attributes can be of type Object (User, Role, User type, Message form, Document, Department), Text (free text field with a limited size), Note (the Note field gives the possibility to write a longer text).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-set-up-a-process-chart">How to set up a process chart</h3>
<p>After you have created a new document of type Process chart and filled in the related data in the Document data tab, you should click Save. That makes the Process chart setup tab appear. When you first click on the Process chart setup tab, the system automatically creates a process with the same name as the newly created document and 4 main steps. You can see that in the left part of the page in a Tree structure. Every time you click on a phase in the Tree, the page on the right is updated with the options related to the phase you selected in the Tree. You can also right click on a phase in the tree to get the same or (sometimes) additional options.</p>

You can also select the position, which is the order in which this step needs to be done within its parent phase. This button appears when the selected phase has no children of type task.</p>
<p>Please note: By default, the main process has 4 main steps to which you can add more if you wish by clicking on this button. If your process is to be comprised of tasks instead of steps, you will need to delete the default steps one by one by right clicking on their names on the tree and selecting Delete from the available options. Then the Add task button will also appear.</p>

This will copy that process inside the current document, which you will be able to see immediately in the tree structure on the left. Any changes done to the original chart after the import will not affect the current process chart. You will also get the option to &ldquo;Replace name with imported process name&rdquo;.

<h4 id="edit">Edit</h4>
<p>This option comes up when you right click on a phase in the Tree, and gives the same options that appear on the right side of the page when you left click on the name of a phase.</p>
<h4 id="delete">Delete</h4>
<p>This option comes up only when you right click on a phase in the Tree. If the phase that you are trying to delete has children, you will be informed of how many child nodes it has and you will be asked if you want to delete them all together with the selected phase or if you want to move them under a new parent node and which one. Otherwise, you will only get a confirmation message before actually deleting the selected phase.</p>
<h4 id="change-parent">Change parent</h4>
<p>This option comes up when you right click on a phase in the Tree. It gives you the possibility to move the selected phase by selecting a new parent node for it. You can move it under any other phase that has no other children or that has children of the same type as the one you are trying to move (steps or tasks).</p>
<h4 id="add-responsible">Add responsible</h4>
<p>Here you can select who will be responsible for the selected phase with what kind of responsibility. You can set multiple responsible parties for a phase. First you select the responsibility (from the responsibilities configured on the main process level). You can write the responsible in a free text field (in all the languages set up on the main process level) or select from one of the available qm+ objects, User, Role, User type and Department. After you select the Object type you can also select its value from the list below. All responsible parties that you will set here will appear in a table below the button. You can later edit or delete a responsible using the respective icons

<ul>
<li>Object: User, Role, User type, Message form, Document, Department (dependent on the department which is selected in the Navigator). If there is a selected Department here, we will use this node as the starting point when displaying the chart display page.</li>
<li>Text: free text field with a limited size (50 characters).</li>
<li>Note: The Note field gives the possibility to write a longer text (255 characters). In the diagram, only a note mark is shown in the attribute list, while the note itself is displayed outside the figure at the bottom of the page in a separate Notes table.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also select the position, which is the order in which this attribute will show within its phase (compared to the other attributes, if any).</p>
<p>All attributes that you will set here will appear in the Attributes table below the button. You can later edit or delete an attribute using the respective icons

 Process chart (the graphical representation of the process) and 

  <img src="https://docs3.qmplus.com/images/Application_side_tree.png"  width="" />


 Responsibility matrix (if any responsible parties have been defined). Both of these buttons are at the bottom of the page and open a new window. You can only have one of these views open at a time.</p>
<p>When the document is opened, it will automatically get a meta-table that contains data about the document, identical to the one added to documents of type Written document.</p>
<p>Both views of the document can be exported to a .pdf file. Clicking on the Show as pdf button takes you to the page Option page for process reports.</p>
<h4 id="process-chart-view">Process chart view</h4>
<p>The name of the process is shown above the chart at the center. Steps are represented by yellow boxes and are connected to their parent phase with black arrows, while tasks are represented by light blue boxes and are connected to their parent phase with blue lines. The phase (step or task) name is shown in bold inside the box, at the top.</p>
<p>On the upper right part of the page, you can see the Display settings for the whole chart, all of which start preselected. Please note that if you click on the Show as pdf button, the report will contain the same chart that is shown in this window, based on the selected display settings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Show responsibles: The responsible parties for each phase are shown in a red font below the phase name.</li>
<li>Show attributes:
<ul>
<li>Attributes of type Message form are shown in a blue font, and have the icon 

  <img src="https://docs3.qmplus.com/images/Application_form_edit.png"  width="" />

<li>Attributes of type Document are shown in a blue font, and have the icon 

  <img src="https://docs3.qmplus.com/images/Link.png"  width="" />


 in front. If you click on the document name, the document will open in a separate window.</li>
<li>Attributes of type Note are shown in a black font, and they only appear as &ldquo;Note1&rdquo;, &ldquo;Note 2&rdquo; etc inside a phase. These are clickable and take you to the aggregated Notes table which appears below the chart and contains the various phases that contain Notes attributes and the text written inside each Note.</li>
<li>All other types of attributes are shown in a black font.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Display full chart: Displays the full chart. If this is not selected, then only the phases of the first level are shown in the chart. When you move the mouse cursor over the various phase names, it changes to the hand cursor if the phase is clickable, which means that it has children. Clicking on the phase name or in the empty space inside the phase expands the tree below it by one level.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="responsibility-matrix-view">Responsibility matrix view</h4>
<p>If at least one responsible has been defined for a phase of the process, then the process chart can also be displayed in a matrix format that lists all the phases of the process in the first column in a hierarchical structure and the responsible parties in the first row. Inside the matrix, the responsibility codes are shown. If a phase has a Document attribute, the icon 

  <img src="https://docs3.qmplus.com/images/Link.png"  width="" />


 will appear next to the phase name. You can click on it to see the name of that document which is also a a hyperlink, and clicking on it opens the document in a separate window. Below the responsibility matrix is the Responsibility overview table, which explains the Responsibilities (codes, names, additional information) that are available for this process.</p>

<h1 id="category-group">Category group</h1>
<p>A category group is used for grouping categories within the same topic and for setting properties for categories. In a message form, a category group is displayed as a headline over its corresponding categories. How it is displayed and how it works depends on the category group type. Each category group that is created, creates automatically a new report under Reports.</p>
<p>Category groups can also be used to identify groups of specific messages and actions via the search page for messages and the search page for actions.</p>
<p>Managed under Edit category group.</p>
<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>Show for the language: The name of a category group can be set once for every language that is activated in the system. Appears only for customers who have multiple active languages.</li>

<p>A document group is a grouping of documents used to control which group of documents will appear under Info. Each document group is shown in a coloured box with the document group&rsquo;s name as the heading. A document group must contain at least one document belonging to the selected document tab for it to appear under the relative tab under Info. If a document group has documents that belong to various document tabs, then the document group will appear in each of these document tabs.</p>
<p>Managed under Edit document group.</p>
<p>Documents can be assigned to document groups under Edit document data.</p>

</ul>
<h1 id="hearing">Hearing</h1>
<p>A hearing is used when a group of users should be able to comment on the contents of a document. The hearing is connected to a version of a document, so that there can be several hearing rounds on the same document.</p>
<p>A hearing goes through the following phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>On hearing</li>
<li>For approval</li>
<li>Approved</li>
</ul>
<p>A hearing is created under Edit document data, under the tab Hearing / Approval. It can be answered under Reply to a hearing that appears under Info, when opening the received hearing notification. A user receives a notification that (s)he has to participate in a hearing or that (s)he has to approve it under Cases I am responsible for and possibly by e-mail.</p>
<h1 id="log-reports">Log reports</h1>
<p>Log is a tab under Reports.</p>
<p>The graphs for the log messages are shown here.</p>
<p>This tab appears only if the log messages are enabled.</p>
<h1 id="manager">Manager</h1>
<p>One of the preconfigured user types in the system delivered with the standard version. Name and roles for all user types may be altered by the System administrator. The capabilities of the user type are defined by the system roles assigned to it.</p>
<h1 id="message-status">Message status</h1>
<p>Messages in Qm+ have a status that represents where they are in the handling process. The status of a message changes under Message process, the status of an action changes under Action process.</p>
<ul>
<li>New: The message is only registered.</li>
<li>Sent to case handler: The message has been assigned to a responsible person with a deadline.</li>
<li>Action in progress: Only under Archive. The message is connected to an action that has not yet been approved.</li>
<li>Closed:
<ul>
<li>Under Reports: The message has been connected to an action.</li>
<li>Under Archive: The action that the message is connected to has been approved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rejected: The message has been rejected.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a message is connected to an action or rejected, it will be locked and it will no longer be possible to edit or process it, except from users with the system role content administrator.</p>
<p>Messages that are handled immediately, will be closed directly.</p>
<h1 id="print">Print</h1>
<p>Opens the print dialog of your browser in order to print the current page.</p>
<p>If you do not want to print the entire image or the print command does not print the part of the screen you want, try clicking the right button of the mouse in the field you want printed. Then choose Print from the menu that appears.</p>
<p>For users with high screen resolution the print out can be larger than the printer paper size. Trick to fix it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose reduced size for the printing. How this is done varies between different browsers and printers. Look for Scale, Reduce / Enlarge or a percentage (%) field. These can usually be found under the advanced options.</li>
<li>Reduce the size of your browser window so that it looks more like the paper in the printer.</li>
<li>Lower the resolution of your screen.</li>
<li>Copy the part of the page you want to print out and paste it into an external program such as Word or a photo program, and print it from there. You can do this by pressing Prt Scr (Print Screen) on your keyboard and then pasting it by Ctrl + v at the desired application (for Windows PCs).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to save the page as a PDF file instead of printing it on a printer, you can download and install the program PDFCreator. Next time you select Print or press Ctrl + P in your browser, you will be able to select PDFCreator as the printer.</p>
<h1 id="question">Question</h1>
<p>A list consists of topics and questions. A question may have an extra information field to provide additional information on the question. For survey forms, each question is also associated with an alternative group.</p>
<p>Questions are managed from Edit list content.</p>
<h1 id="reference">Reference</h1>
<p>A reference is a document that is associated with an activity or a list and has also been marked as a reference. References are shown in tables and overviews along with the name of the corresponding activity. Activities inherit the reference affiliation from the list to which they are associated.</p>
<p>Reference functionality is an option that is not included in the standard version.</p>
<h1 id="reviewer">Reviewer</h1>
<p>Reviewer is a user type in the standard version of Qm+ that has the same access rights as the user type manager. That means full access to read all cases within their remit, as well as reports via Reports and Activity plan. Reviewers have no access to Admin. Reviewers can register new messages on their own department and can edit only their own cases.</p>
<h1 id="role-group">Role group</h1>
<p>Role groups are used to sort roles. They are intended to be used by those customers who need to assign many different roles to multiple users. Instead of picking out roles one by one, one can instead simply assign all those roles in a role group for the various users.</p>
<p>All roles belong to one or more role groups. The roles that have not been assigned to a role group belong to no role group.</p>
<p>Role groups are managed under Edit role group.</p>
<h1 id="search-criteria">Search criteria</h1>
<p>Search criteria are the selected options when performing a search. They define what we search for.</p>
<p>They are shown in a table above the search results whenever a search is performed. A search may be started from Reports, from Search message, from Search action or by clicking on the risk matrix under Risk. All search results are shown in table form under Archive or as charts under Reports, under their respective tab.</p>
<ul>
<li>All criteria shown in drop-down menus can be changed. Such changes update the search results.</li>
<li>Criteria followed by the 

  <img src="https://docs3.qmplus.com/images/Delete.png"  width="" />


 icon can be removed from the search criteria. This also updates the search results.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="single-question-view">Single question view</h1>
<p>Display type for lists. Used primarily for survey forms. Shows one question at a time with its own comment field if it should be possible to comment on the question. The answer is saved only when the Save button at the last question is pressed.</p>
<h1 id="subgroup">Subgroup</h1>
<p>Subgroups are used to create grouped drop-down menus of categories in a message form.</p>
<p>The name of the category group to which the other groups are subgroups will be the title above the drop-down menu. Any categories in this group will then be listed at the top of the drop-down menu. Under these, there will be a heading in the drop-down menu for each subgroup. All the categories in the subgroup will be listed under this heading.</p>
<p>It is possible to select only one of the categories in such a drop-down menu.</p>
<p>This is a special functionality that one can usually discuss with QmPlus AS before using it.</p>
<h1 id="topic">Topic</h1>
<p>A topic in a list is a headline over a set of questions. A topic can have an extra information field that appears under the heading when the list is answered. All questions in a list must belong to a topic.</p>
<p>Maintained under Edit list content.</p>
<h1 id="answer-type">Answer type</h1>
<p>Every question in a list can have an answer type.</p>
<h3 id="answer-types">Answer types:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Single choice: One answer to each question. Even if one answer for a question is already selected, you should still answer the question. This is the default answer which will be used unless a change is made.</li>
<li>Multiple choice: You can select as many alternative answers to each question as you wish, from none to all.</li>
<li>Text: There will not be any check boxes for this question, only a comment field. Does not apply to the list version.</li>
<li>Free text number: A number can be entered in response to this question. The graph will show the sum of all the numbers written as a reply to such a question.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tip: Use the answer type Multi choice for questions with only one alternative answer, as in a checklist. Otherwise it will not be possible for users to remove the check mark if they change their mind.</p>
<h1 id="case">Case</h1>
<p>A case in Qm+ is either a message, an action, a hearing or an audit.</p>
<h1 id="category">Category</h1>
<p>A category is in most cases a checkbox in a message form. All categories belong to a category group. The category group type of the category group determines how the category will appear in the message form. All information that is entered in relation to a category in a message form can be extracted as a report via Reports. The categories can also be used to identify groups of specific messages via the search page for messages and the search page for actions.</p>
<p>Managed under Edit category.</p>
<h3 id="data-1">Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>Show for the language: The name of a category can be set once for every language that is activated in the system. Appears only for customers who have multiple active languages.</li>
<li>Category group: The category&rsquo;s group. The category group type of the category group determines how this category will look like in a message form. A text at the bottom of this screen describes the type of the selected group.</li>
<li>Category name: The name used to represent the category. A category can have one name for every language that is activated in the system.</li>
<li>Priority: Low, Medium, High. The predefined priority of a category. Can be overridden by the person who fills out the message form. The priority of a message is the highest priority of the checked categories unless it is overridden by the user.</li>
<li>Cost: The predefined cost of a category. Can be overridden by the person who fills out the message form. The cost of a message is the sum of the costs of the checked categories, unless it is overridden by the user. Cost functionality can be removed for those who wish it.</li>
<li>From department: The category is available from the selected department and its subordinate departments.</li>
<li>Attached document: The document that will be activated if you click on the category in the message form.</li>
<li>Information: Text field that is visible when you hold the cursor over the category in the message form.</li>
<li>Risk data: Appear only for the categories belonging to a category group with the category group type Risk. Used to set different acceptance criteria for various risk categories.
<ul>
<li>Start yellow risk area: Overviews of this category will give a yellow risk value from (and including) this risk value.</li>
<li>Start red risk area: Overviews of this category will give a red risk value from (and including) this risk value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="category-group-type">Category group type</h1>
<p>The category group type of a category group determines how the categories in the group will be displayed and answered in a message form.</p>
<h3 id="types">Types</h3>
<h4 id="defining-category-1">Defining category</h4>
<p>Intended to describe what is the topic of a message. Single choice for the whole message form. If there are several defining groups in a message form, it will only be possible to check one category in one of the groups. A message form can only be saved if a category which belongs to a defining category group is checked. Defining categories are obligatory to fill out in a a message form. Defining categories usually appear at the upper part of the screen to the left with an orange background colour and are marked with the icon Tag blue.png.</p>
<h4 id="single-choice">Single choice</h4>
<p>Used to provide additional information in a message form. One choice per group. Shown to the left under the defining categories.</p>
<h4 id="multi-choice">Multi Choice</h4>
<p>Used to provide additional information in a message form. Any number can be checked. Shown on the right.</p>
<h4 id="action">Action</h4>
<p>Used to provide detailed information on what kind of action should be used to deal with the conditions that the message is about. Any number can be checked. The categories in this group are taken further in the action, if one is created for a message. Shown in the center below the text fields in the message form.</p>
<h4 id="number">Number</h4>
<p>Provides a text field where any number can be entered. Selecting a group of this type in the Reports would cause the cost graph to be replaced with a graph showing the sum of the values in these fields. Shown to the right in the message form.</p>
<h4 id="risk">Risk</h4>
<p>Each category of this type has two drop-down menus, where a value from 1 to 5 can be selected. The first symbolizes the probability that the event will happen, the second symbolizes the consequence. These values are automatically multiplied to produce a risk value. The risk value gets a colour based on limits set for the category. Messages with values &gt; 0 for a risk category will appear in the risk report under Reports. Shown in the center of the message form under the Action categories.</p>
<h1 id="comment-form">Comment form</h1>
<p>A message form that is associated with a question in a list is called a comment form. This message form is used for registering the comments given when replying to a list. If the display type single question view is used, the text above the comment field will be the name of the first text field in the comment form.</p>
<p>This link between the list and the message form means that all comments on an activity can be handled and given feedback to as if they were ordinary messages.</p>
<p>The comment form for a list can be selected under Edit list information.</p>
<h1 id="filling-out">Filling out</h1>
<p>The function of filling out a list. Its appearance is determined by the list type and the selected display type for the activity.</p>
<p>See &ldquo;Filling out a list form&rdquo; and &ldquo;Filling out a list in single question view&rdquo;.</p>
<h1 id="graph-report-types">Graph report types</h1>
<p>Graph report types can be selected under Reports, Message search and Action search to determine which kind of reports will be displayed.</p>
<h3 id="graph-report-types-1">Graph report types</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Per department: Shows one graph per department for the department which is selected in the Navigator and one for each directly subordinate department to that one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Per department / Per category: If all the category groups are selected in the category group drop-down menu, then one graph per category group will be shown. If a particular category group is selected in the category group drop-down menu, then one graph per department for the department which is selected in the Navigator and one for each directly subordinate department to that one will be shown . This graph is colour coded so that each category in the selected category group will be marked with a different colour. This report has one graph for numbers and one for percentages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Per category / category group: If all the category groups are selected in the category group drop-down menu, then one graph per category group is displayed. If a particular category group is selected in the category group drop-down menu, then one graph per each category that belongs to the selected category group is displayed. When there are many reported messages in a category group, then this is the report that provides the best overview.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Status: Provides a graph bar per message status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Priority: Provides a graph bar per priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distribution over time: Provides a graph bar per unit of time. Which unit is chosen depends on the selected time period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk report: Provides a risk matrix.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>List: Lists all the categories in the report grouped by category group.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="list-type">List type</h1>
<p>The List type controls how a list will be displayed to the user. The different list types are: Checklists, Risk analysis lists and Survey forms.</p>
<h1 id="log-message">Log message</h1>
<p>Log messages are messages that normally do not need to be handled, just registered and saved in the archive. Examples of such use can be minutes and documentation of legal execution. Log messages do not therefore appear under the Inbox unless you use Message process to activate them. The message type log message is not enabled in the standard version.</p>
<p>Log messages are in all other ways identical to the regular messages.</p>
<h1 id="message-type">Message type</h1>
<p>All messages have a message type. A message gets the same message type as the message form it was registered with.</p>
<h3 id="the-different-message-types">The different message types</h3>
<ul>
<li>Message: Common messages.</li>
<li>Log message: Registered in the Log under Archive. Not included in the standard version.</li>
<li>Risk message: Registered in the Risk under Archive. Not included in the standard version.</li>
</ul>
<p>If neither log messages or risk messages are enabled in your system, the term message type will not be used.</p>
<h1 id="mobile-version">Mobile version</h1>
<p>The mobile version of Qm+ is a separate interface adapted for display on mobile devices. The customization is done by sending over only the most important information and displays everything as short texts. It is possible to register messages, checklists and survey forms in this version. All information registered is visible in the normal Qm+ version in the same way as everything else.</p>
<p>The homepage for the mobile version is wap.qmplus.net. Logging in is done using the same company, username and password as for the normal login.</p>
<p>The mobile version is an additional module that must be ordered separately.</p>
<h1 id="printer-friendly">Printer friendly</h1>
<p>A printer friendly version is a message form or an action that is adapted in order to print well on paper.</p>
<h1 id="risk-matrix">Risk matrix</h1>
<p>A risk matrix shows an overview of Probability and Consequence in a 5 x 5 matrix. The fields are coloured green, yellow and red to symbolise the different acceptance levels for the risk value.</p>
<p>Qm+ has a risk matrix under Reports for each message type. The matrix under Message Reports refers to real events, while the matrix under Risk Reports shows an overview of potential incidents. The matrix of potential incidents appears also under Archive / Risk.</p>
<h1 id="risk-value">Risk value</h1>
<p>Risk value (R) is the result of the multiplication of probability (P) and consequence (C).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P * C = R.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The risk value is often visualised in a risk matrix.</p>
<p>At a risk assessment, one wishes to reduce the risk value. This is done by showing the probability- and consequence-reducing measures.</p>
<h1 id="role-overview">Role overview</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>

  <img src="https://docs3.qmplus.com/images/Group.png"  width="" />


 Role overview: Used for assigning roles to a document. Opens from Edit document data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A document without roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>is available to all users from the department where the document was created and from its subordinate departments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A document with associated roles appears under Info only for:</p>
<ul>
<li>users assigned to one or more of the same roles.</li>
<li>users who have chosen a department associated with one or more of the same roles of the document.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Roles do not limit the access to documents under Admin / Documents.</p>
<h1 id="standard-version">Standard version</h1>
<p>The standard version of Qm+ is the one with the system settings that is given to new customers if they do not ask for any changes.</p>
<p>The customer&rsquo;s contact person with QmPlus AS may order changes from the standard version. Most changes to system settings are done free of charge. Contact <a href="mailto:drift@qmplus.com">drift@qmplus.com</a> if you have questions or change requests.</p>
<p>See system roles for the set up of user types in the standard version.</p>
<h1 id="super-user">Super user</h1>
<p>The super user is a user who has taken the super user course of Qm+. The super user has the highest access to Qm+ within the company. The super user will assist the other users in the company and will act as local support for Qm+.</p>
<p>All super users are entitled to free telephone support from Qm+ and can take advantage of this if they receive a question from their company users that they need help to answer. As a rule, one or more of the company&rsquo;s super users also function as contact persons between the company and QmPlus AS.</p>
<p>All requests for changing some functionality in the system must be communicated via the customer&rsquo;s contact person, so that we know that this is a request of the entire company.</p>
<h1 id="system-role">System role</h1>
<p>System roles are roles that are preset in the system and provide specific rights for using Qm+. System roles are defined by QmPlus AS but can be given from certain super users to users or user types. This is advanced functionality and is usually not turned on for new customers at the beginning. Contact <a href="mailto:drift@qmplus.com">drift@qmplus.com</a> if you need this right or if you have questions.</p>
<p>You can find a list of the available system roles here.</p>
<h1 id="tab">Tab</h1>
<p>The navigation structure of Qm+ is made up of tabs. They have a name that describes the location of the system you can go to if you click on them. Most also have a descriptive text that appears when you hover the mouse pointer over them.</p>
<p>Tabs also describe where you are in the system. The tabs that are darker than the others are selected.</p>
<p>Example :</p>


  <img src="https://docs3.qmplus.com/images/Arkfanebeskrivelse.png"  width="" />



<h1 id="user">User</h1>
<p>A user is a set of information that identifies a real person who will be using Qm+.</p>
<p>Managed under Admin / Users / Edit user information by users having access to that tab or under Preferences for others.</p>
<h3 id="data-2">Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>User name: Used by the user for logging into the system. Distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters. Must be unique for each customer.</li>
<li>Department: The department to which the user belongs.</li>
<li>Type: The user&rsquo;s user type.</li>
<li>Password: Used by the user for logging into the system. Distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters.</li>
<li>Repeat password: Must be identical with the password field in order for the user&rsquo;s data to be saved.</li>
<li>First name: The user&rsquo;s first name.</li>
<li>Middle name: The user&rsquo;s middle name.</li>
<li>Surname: The user&rsquo;s last name.</li>
<li>Email address: The user&rsquo;s email address. Some functionality of the system is linked to the user&rsquo;s email address. It is therefore preferred that each user has a unique email address.</li>
<li>Language: Selection of the display language for the user. Available languages in the system are: Norwegian (bokmÃ¥l), Norwegian (nynorsk), English, Swedish and Danish (not translated framework for Danish). The available languages for each customer will vary.</li>
<li>Mobile number: Can be used for receiving SMS from the system, if this functionality is activated.</li>
<li>Comment: Free text field for additional information about the user.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="user-type">User type</h1>
<p>Name and roles for all user types may be altered by the System administrator. User types may also be added and removed. The capabilities of a user type are defined by the system roles assigned to it. A user must have one user type for each department the user is attached to. For a logged in user with multiple user types, only the roles attached to the user type of the department the user is currently logged in at, will be active. In the Standard version four user types are preconfigured: Manager, Case handler and Reviewer have the complete interface, while Worker has the Simplified interface.</p>
<h3 id="manager-1">Manager</h3>
<p>They have full access to the system in the standard version. Can have limited or increased access with the help of system roles.</p>
<h3 id="case-handler">Case handler</h3>
<p>Same access rights as the Manager, but the access to Admin is replaced by Preferences.</p>
<p>Managers and Case handlers appear automatically as possible recipients (case handlers) for messages under Messages/NC / Message process within their department. If it must be possible to send messages across the organisation, for example from the Health Department to the Technical department, at least one user of the user type Manager or Case handler in that department must be set under the tab Admin / Rules, Rule type &ldquo;Additional case handlers&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="reviewer-1">Reviewer</h3>
<p>They have the same read access as Managers. They can only edit their own information, but may comment on all cases they can read. They appear automatically as possible recipients of the messages under Inform in the Messages/NC / Message process on their department. Reviewers may only register new messages on the department they are registered on, even though they have the navigator. They have the tab Preferences instead of Admin.</p>
<h3 id="worker">Worker</h3>
<p>They have their own simple interface that only allows access to their own information.</p>
<h1 id="worker-1">Worker</h1>
<p>User type that in the standard version gives the users a simple interface, from which they can access only their own cases.</p>
<h1 id="action-status">Action status</h1>
<p>An action in Qm+ has an status that shows where it is in the handling process. The status of an action changes under Action process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Under planning: The action is being planned. Text fields must be filled out, categorisation and cost must be set and one or more users must be made responsible for executing the action.</li>
<li>Under execution: The action has been sent to the person(s) who will execute it. When all the persons responsible for executing the action have checked out the field &ldquo;Executed&quot;and have written their comments, it can be sent for approval.</li>
<li>Under approval: The action is waiting for approval from the person who created it.</li>
<li>Approved: The action has been approved and can no longer be changed. Super users with the system role content administrator can still make changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>An action under execution or under approval may be sent backwards in the process by using the &laquo; buttons in the status field of the Action process.</p>
<h1 id="activity-group">Activity group</h1>
<p>Activities are organised in activity groups. This organisation has no influence on the system beyond the fact that it makes it easier to identify activities when there are many of them. In the Calendar under the Activity plan, activities are shown per activity group.</p>
<h1 id="activity-report">Activity report</h1>
<p>An activity report can be used to write a final report for an activity. The activity report can be written by pressing the Report button under Comments to the activity.</p>
<p>Which message form will be used in the activity report is determined under Edit list information.</p>
<p>Activity reports are not included in the standard version and must be ordered specifically.</p>
<h1 id="alternative-answer">Alternative answer</h1>
<p>An alternative answer is an answer you can choose to a question in a survey form. All the alternative answers you can choose from for one question are called an alternative group. Managed under Edit alternative answers.</p>
<h3 id="data-3">Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>Number: Determines the sorting of the alternative answers in the alternative group.</li>
<li>Text: The displayed text for that alternative answer. Each alternative answer may have one text for each enabled language.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="alternative-groups-overview">Alternative groups overview</h1>
<p>All the alternative groups belong to an alternative groups overview. This is used only to distinguish between alternative groups when editing alternative answers and under the tab Alternative groups. Managed from the tab Alternative groups.</p>
<h1 id="case-handler-1">Case handler</h1>
<p>The Case handler is a user type in the standard version in Qm+ that has approximately the same rights as the user type manager. That means full access to read and modify all cases within his/her remit, as well as reports via Reports and the Activity plan. A case handler does not have access to Admin.</p>
<h1 id="category-dependency">Category dependency</h1>
<p>A category dependency is used for controlling when a category is shown in a message form. Only categories without dependencies and categories that have all their dependencies satisfied are shown in the message form.</p>
<p>A category dependency is only used for the actual message form it is set up for. A category may only have one dependency against each of the other categories in that message form.</p>
<p>A category satisfies its dependencies when it both:</p>
<ul>
<li>satisfies all &ldquo;And&rdquo; dependencies. If it has no &ldquo;And&rdquo; dependencies it is considered as satisfied.</li>
<li>satisfies at least one &ldquo;Or&rdquo; dependency or it has no &ldquo;Or&rdquo; dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Managed under Edit category dependency.</p>
<h1 id="checklist">Checklist</h1>
<p>A checklist is a list that is displayed with checkboxes in front of the question. To be able to edit alternative answers, the list type survey form must be used. A checklist is intended to be used as a &ldquo;find the error list&rdquo;. That lists a series of common errors within the area to be examined. The users then check the point in the list if they know of the error. See list for explanation of data fields.</p>
<h1 id="comment-message">Comment message</h1>
<p>A comment message is an additional text response to a question in a list. Comment messages are registered in a normal message form. Only the first text field in the message form that is connected to the list will show as a comment field inside the list.</p>
<p>Comment messages can be handled in the same way as the other messages. In the standard version, comment messages do not appear under Inbox unless someone has transferred them to a case handler, set a deadline or created an action for them.</p>
<p>Show comment list in Activity plan is used to get an overview of the comment messages for an activity.</p>
<p>You can get an overview of all comment messages from the tab Comment reports under Reports or from the Comments tab under Archive.</p>
<h1 id="default-case-handler">Default case handler</h1>
<p>If a message form has a default case handler, the messages registered with this message form will appear on the Cases I am responsible for page of the default case handler instead of the Manager of the department where the message was registered. The message will still be registered on the department it was registered and will appear under Reports and Search.</p>
<p>If the same message form is set up with multiple default case handlers with overlapping departments, the user registering the message will be able to choose between them from a drop-down menu during registration. In the registration screen, there is also a checkbox for whether to send an email to the selected case handler when the message is registered.</p>
<h1 id="department">Department</h1>
<p>A department is a set of information that identifies a physical location or an organisational unit that will be used as the reporting unit in Qm+. Active departments can be selected in the Navigator. Managed under Admin / Organisation / Edit department. If a department is moved within the organisational structure, all associated data and records will automatically follow.</p>
<p>Function under Organisation.</p>
<h3 id="fields-1">Fields</h3>
<ul>
<li>Department name: The name used for the department in the system. Will appear in the Navigator.</li>
<li>Subdepartment of: The department under which this department appears in the Navigator. This department will inherit the lists, the message forms, the documents and the activities from the department above it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="advanced-options-1">Advanced options</h4>
<ul>
<li>The department&rsquo;s roles: The roles associated with this department.
<ul>
<li>Roles associated with a department apply to all users of the active department. That means all employees of that department and all other users who have selected that department in the navigator.</li>
<li>Roles associated with a department are used to control the accessibility of documents, forms and activities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The department&rsquo;s main tasks: Departments may be related to categories in a category group classified as Tasks. This is meant to visualize the department&rsquo;s main tasks, and has currently no system effect beyond that.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="display-criterion">Display criterion</h1>
<p>A display criterion is a criterion that can be set on a question or a group of questions in a survey form. The most common use is to set up a question to show only if a particular alternative answer is selected on a previous question.</p>
<p>Display criteria are set for each survey form under Edit alternative answers.</p>
<h3 id="behaviour">Behaviour</h3>
<ul>
<li>Specific group, Element = None, Alternative = None: A checkbox appears before the group name with the text &ldquo;Show&rdquo; when the list is filled out. This box must be checked, in order for the questions in this group to show.</li>
<li>Specific group, specific Element, Alternative = None: The question shows only if the particular question is not answered.</li>
<li>Specific group, specific Element, specific Alternative: The question shows only if the particular question is answered with the specific alternative answer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Display criteria work for the list version and the single question view.</p>
<h1 id="document">Document</h1>
<p>A document is a text written in Qm+, a reference to a file, a reference to a web page or a folder. Shown in the table under info for all users who have access to them, according to the document&rsquo;s department and roles.</p>
<p>Managed under Edit document data. A simple version control also exists on that page.</p>
<h3 id="data-4">Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>Name: Used to identify the document in tables and overviews.</li>
<li>Document type:
<ul>
<li>Written document: The document is written and maintained in the internal text editor of Qm+. When the document is opened, it will automatically get a meta-table that contains data about the document. The table shows who has created the document, when it was changed, the customer&rsquo;s logo and possibly the hearing status it has. The table can be customized on a per customer level.</li>
<li>Link: The document is a link to a page on the Internet, a document written in Qm+ or a file uploaded to Qm+.</li>
<li>File: The document is a file that was uploaded to Qm+ and stored on the server of QmPlus AS.</li>
<li>Folder: The document is only a folder that contains other documents under Info.</li>
<li>Process chart: The document is written and maintained in the Process chart setup page of Qm+ and can be displayed in two modes, Process chart and Responsibility matrix. When the document is opened, it will automatically get a meta-table that contains data about the document, identical to the one added to documents of type Written document. After a process chart is saved, it is not possible to change the type of the document again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Document group: The document&rsquo;s group. Determines in which box the document will appear under Info.</li>
<li>Document tab: Determines under which tab the document will appear under Info. Appears only if this functionality is turned on. In the standard version, all documents are shown under the tab Managing documents under Info.</li>
<li>Subdocument of: A subdocument will be shown only when the document above it is extended by holding the cursor over the 

  <img src="https://docs3.qmplus.com/images/Arrowclosed.gif"  width="" />


 icon. Make sure to choose something in this menu after you have selected the Document group and the Document tab.</li>
<li>Address: Where is the document. If it is a file that was uploaded, the address field will be set automatically. Do not make changes to it afterwards.</li>
<li>From department: The document will be available from the selected department and its subordinate departments.</li>
<li>Shown for subdepartments?: If no, the document will only appear under Info when the selected department in the &ldquo;From department&rdquo; is selected in the Navigator.</li>
<li>Created by: The name of the user who has created this document.</li>
<li>Version: Version number. Shows how many times there were changes made on the document. It will not be updated if the change is done outside Qm+.</li>
<li>Roles: An unlimited number of roles can be associated with the document. A user must have at least one of these in order to be able to see the document under the Info page. Does not affect the availability of the document in the message forms or lists to which the document is attached.</li>
<li>Last modified: Date when the document was last modified.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="filling-out-pdf-forms">Filling out PDF forms</h1>
<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>It has been requested that the details of a message which will be reported with the help of a PDF form, should be automatically filled in. If a form has been linked to a PDF, the user will have a new opportunity to select a message form for filling data into the PDF. After the PDF document is opened, the data are already copied in the correct fields and the user can fill in the rest of the form.</p>
<h3 id="layout">Layout</h3>
<p>In order for the data of a form to be able to be exported to a PDF form, the fields must be manually connected to the fields of the PDF. Unfortunately, for the moment, this can only be done directly in the database, ie, the users must ask Qm+ to do it for them.</p>
<p>In order to connect a form to a PDF, we need the PDF and the message it will be connected to. In addition we need an accurate description of which fields in the PDF will be connected to which fields in the message.</p>
<h1 id="gps-coordinates">GPS coordinates</h1>
<p>

  <img src="https://docs3.qmplus.com/images/Map.png"  width="" />


 GPS coordinates is a tab under Edit message form.</p>
<p>Messages registered through the mobile application send the GPS coordinates of the location of the mobile device at the time of registration. Use this page to decide if these coordinates will appear in the Message process page and in the pdf reports. More options will appear in this page soon.</p>
<h1 id="list">List</h1>
<p>A list is a form used to collect information. Lists are managed under Admin / Forms and are sent out from the Activity plan. The appearance of a list is determined by the selected list type.</p>
<h3 id="data-5">Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>Show for the language: The name of a list can be set once for every language that is activated in the system. Appears only for customers who have multiple active languages.</li>
<li>List name: Used to identify the list in tables and menus.</li>
<li>List type: Used to organise the lists in various overviews under Admin. Has no practical significance.</li>
<li>Registered by department: The department where the list was created. A list can be used from the department where it was created and from its subordinate departments.</li>
<li>Attached message form: The message form that is used to store comments on the list.</li>
<li>Attached category: The category which will be selected in the attached message form when the comment is written.</li>
<li>Attached report form: The message form that will be used to save reports to an activity where the list has been used.</li>
<li>Attached report category: The category which will be selected in the attached message form when the report is written.
<ul>
<li>The report form and the report categories are not included in the standard version but can be activated for all customers who want them. In this case, contact <a href="mailto:drift@qmplus.com">drift@qmplus.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>List comment: A textual comment that will appear at the top of list when it is filled out.</li>
<li>Attached documents: A link above the list that opens the selected document.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="list-version">List version</h1>
<p>Display type for lists. Used mainly for checklists and risk analysis lists. Shows all the questions in a list. Opportunity to comment comes up on page two after Save is pressed.</p>
<p>All lists that appear when you log in to Qm+ in the normal way (not when logging in via a link in an e-mail that takes you directly to the list), are using the list version.</p>
<h1 id="periodic-activity">Periodic activity</h1>
<p>A periodic activity is used when you want to schedule a periodic execution of an activity forward in time. The period is how frequently the activity will be carried out, for example, daily, weekly, annually.</p>
<p>The period and the individual dates can be managed under Periodic activity setup, and the other activity data under Edit activity. Individual dates for a periodic activity can be deleted under Activities.</p>
<h1 id="priority">Priority</h1>
<p>Messages in Qm+ may have different priorities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Low: Highlighted in green.</li>
<li>Medium: Highlighted in yellow.</li>
<li>High: highlighted in red.</li>
</ul>
<p>An action gets the same priority as the message attached to it with the highest priority.</p>
<h1 id="repetitive-activity">Repetitive activity</h1>
<p>A repetitive activity is an activity that can be filled out an unlimited number of times by each participant. Can also be used for registration of anonymous external surveys where all responses are registered on the same user.</p>
<h1 id="risk-analysis-list">Risk analysis list</h1>
<p>A risk analysis list is a list that is displayed with a drop-down menu for the probability and a drop-down menu for the consequence of each question. See list for explanation of data fields.</p>
<h1 id="risk-message">Risk message</h1>
<p>Risk messages are messages used to create a risk overview for your company. It is up to the company whether the risk messages should be handled or if they should only be registered and stored in the archive. Our recommendation is that they are not handled, only updated annually. Risk messages can only be closed by QmPlus AS (as an exception), as they should not normally be handled. Messages registered here do not appear in the Inbox unless you use Message process to activate them. The message type risk message is not enabled in the standard version.</p>
<h1 id="role">Role</h1>
<p>A role can be assigned to users, user types, departments, activities, message forms and documents. They provide rights and restrictions. Generally one can say that a user or a user&rsquo;s department must have the same role as an activity, a message form or a document in order to have access to it. Common roles can be set by the customer&rsquo;s super user.</p>
<p>Roles are sorted in role groups and managed under Edit role.</p>
<p>A special type of roles called system roles give extended rights for use of Qm+. System roles are set by QmPlus AS and they can be assigned to some super users. This is an advanced functionality and is usually not given to new customers. Contact <a href="mailto:drift@qmplus.com">drift@qmplus.com</a> if you need this right or if you have questions.</p>
<h3 id="data-6">Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>Name: A role can have one name for each language that is activated in the system.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rules-submenu-message-form">Rules submenu message form</h1>
<p>

  <img src="https://docs3.qmplus.com/images/Wrench.png"  width="" />


 Rules submenu message form is a tab under Edit message form.</p>
<p>Use this page to get an overview of the rules which are associated with the message form. See Rules for a more detailed description of the table contents and functionality.</p>
<p>Please note that a message registered with a message form without case handlers follows the normal procedure and appears in the Inbox / My current cases of the nearest manager. In most cases this is the best solution.</p>
<h1 id="sub-activity">Sub-activity</h1>
<p>An activity can have sub-activities. They have no effect other than the fact that they are visually grouped together under Activities and Calendar.</p>
<h1 id="survey-form">Survey form</h1>
<p>A type of list. Provides full flexibility to change the answers and comments for all questions. When used as a traditional survey, it is often worth using the display type &ldquo;single question view&rdquo;.</p>
<h1 id="the-action-process">The action process</h1>
<p>The action process is the process from when an action is created until it is approved and closed.</p>
<p>Followed up through the Action process page.</p>
<ul>
<li>Under planning: All actions start with this status. In this phase, the action is being planned. First give a name to the action so that it becomes easy to identify it later, and enter the budget if you use this field. The text fields Corrective action and How to prevent repetition must be filled out so that those who will execute the action will know what to do. The action categories may also be selected now. The last thing you have to do is to select those who should execute the action and give them a deadline. This is done in the mandatory panel Persons responsible. Click on Send to execution &raquo; or the &raquo; button in the Status panel to save the action and change its status to Under execution.</li>
<li>Under execution: In this phase, the work described in the action will be executed. If the time registration fields are enabled, the executors can log the hours they have spent carrying out the action per day. Then those who carried out the action must tick the Executed box. They can also write a comment in the Comment field and fill in the Actual cost if they know it. When all the changes have been done, use the button Send to approval &raquo; or the &raquo; button in the Status panel. This saves the action and change its status to Under approval.</li>
<li>Under approval: Here the person who created the action will make sure everything is in order before (s)he approves the action.</li>
<li>Approved: An approved action is closed and locked and can not be changed except by users with the system role content administrator. Comments can still be sent out to all involved users.</li>

<p>ESCALATION_DAYS : Determines whether cases are escalated after exceeding deadlines. The value of the option determines how many days over the period allowed before the case is escalated. The escalation is performed by the night job. When a message is escalated, the message&rsquo;s case handler changes to be the first user the routine meets in a search for users with the System Role Default message receiver in the parent department. If there is no match in the first parent department, its parent is tried until eventually the top of the organization is reached. So, in detail: Upon escalation, it is checked whether the current case handler has the role Default message receiver (the user type Manager is the only one that has it in the standard version). If the current case handler does not have this role, the message is sent to the first user the system finds in the same department (normally the user&rsquo;s manager) who has it. If the current case handler has this role, the message is sent to the first user the system finds in the department above which satisfies the requirement (the manager&rsquo;s manager).</p>

	<p>Here you can manage the company&rsquo;s survey forms and alternative groups.</p>
<p>A survey form or questionnaire is a measuring instrument we use to measure the level differences between variables. Survey forms should be used only when we want to collect empirical data. That means surveys are based on a quantitative method. In order to make valid and reliable measurements it is required that we manage to construct a suervey form that creates a good communication process between the interviewer and the respondent. In a traditional survey it often pays to use the display type &ldquo;show as single question&rdquo;.</p>

    <div class="lead">Info is a tab on the Main Page.</div>
	<p>Used to display the document overview in the system. The documents are organised in different areas of the screen. They can also be distributed under multiple tabs. The document structure is determined by the company&rsquo;s local super user.

 and 

  <img src="https://docs3.qmplus.com/images/Expand.png"  width="" />


 are used to expand and collapse the subdocuments of documents. There is also a search function here that performs free text searches in all the documents that appear in this page.</p>
<p>The document names function as links. Click on a document name to open the document. Especially for documents created in Qm+: You can either open the HTML version by clicking on the document name, or you can get a PDF version of the document by clicking on the 

  <img src="https://docs3.qmplus.com/images/Page_white_acrobat.png"  width="" />


 icon on the right of the document name.</p>
<p>When clicking on the 

  <img src="https://docs3.qmplus.com/images/Page_white_acrobat.png"  width="" />


 icon on the right of documents written in Qm+ that have subdocuments (they have the 

  <img src="https://docs3.qmplus.com/images/Expand.png"  width="" />


 icon in front of them), you get a popup window where you can select if you want the exported .pdf to include only the current document or also its subdocuments.</p>
<p>Folders that contain documents written in Qm+ also have a pdf icon, which prints all such documents in the selected folder in one .pdf file. The pdf report from a folder includes also all sub-documents of internal documents in the printed file (not just the sub-documents of folders). This is intended to correct the problem that arises when one has written each chapter of a big document in a separate Qm+ document and wants to print the entire document as a whole.</p>
<p>You can also get the document in .docx format by clicking on the 

  <img src="https://docs3.qmplus.com/images/Page_white_word.png"  width="" />


 icon. The option for exporting to .docx is not included in the standard version. If you want this option enabled, contact <a href="mailto:drift@qmplus.com">drift@qmplus.com</a>. Please note that the .pdf version is the most suitable for printing. At this point, we cannot guarantee that the .docx produced file will look the same in all editors or that it will open correctly in all versions of Microsoft Office or OpenOffice. This export format should only be used when there is a need for manually updating the report. This functionality is still in test mode.</p>
<p>Documents can appear directly in this page under separate tabs instead of having the name of the document appear as a link. This functionality has to be ordered separately. Contact <a href="mailto:drift@qmplus.com">drift@qmplus.com</a> if you want such a solution.</p>

 Search: Searches for the text that is written in the text field in front of the button. The search results depend on the department which is selected in the navigator, but not on the selected document tab. The search function uses the search engine Lucene.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beneath the title of each document found in the search, the location of the document is displayed. It is shown as Document tab / Document group / Any parent document(s) / Document title.</li>
<li>When a free text search has been done, a set of search filters is displayed above the search results. The values in the filter are not affected by changing the department in the navigator and will remain until you click Close search results.
<ul>
<li>Document tab: Include documents from all or just the selected document tab.</li>
<li>Document group: Include documents from all or just the selected document group.</li>
<li>Department choice: Include documents from all documents available at the selected department or just the documents registered at the selected department.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tip: Include only interesting words. For example, if you wish to search for procedures related to fire, use the keywords &ldquo;procedures fire&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Advanced: See Lucene Query Syntax (<a href="https://www.lucenetutorial.com/lucene-query-syntax.html">https://www.lucenetutorial.com/lucene-query-syntax.html</a>) for detailed information about the syntax for the search field.
<ul>
<li>Searchable fields: Text, URL, DocumentId, Name, Information.</li>
<li>If no fields are specified, all fields are searched. In that case, extra weight is given to the name field.</li>

<h5 id="standard-report-table">Standard report table</h5>
<p>Periodic report that shows a table overview of the most important data for messages summed up for the department which is selected in the Navigator. The data is listed below each other distributed in time periods. The periods are created automatically based on the time frame you have selected for the report. This is the same as in the chart &ldquo;Distribution over time&rdquo;. At the moment there is no possibility to directly export the data or click on them (drill down functionality) in this report. Such functionality is scheduled for a later version of Qm+.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the drop-down menu for the Period type if you want a different periodisation from the automatic one. If the time frame you are searching for does not cover an entire period, the last period and the total period (first column in the table) will show a time frame that spans an entire period. However, there will be no data in the report outside the time frame you have chosen.</li>

<h5 id="process-time-report">Process time report</h5>
<p>Periodic report that displays information for the registered and processed messages and actions. This report takes into account only the selected time period and the selected message type. The figures for average time take into account only messages that have obtained the relevant status. The last periods in the report will therefore usually have lower processing time than the first ones, as the last ones will usually have several open cases that will not be included in the calculation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Messages registered on&hellip; Displays the number of messages registered on the department(s).</li>
<li>Messages processed at&hellip; Displays the number of messages processed (rejected or action created) in the selected period, regardless of where and when the message was registered.</li>
<li>Messages closed at&hellip; Displays the number of messages closed (rejected or action approved) at the department(s), regardless of where the message was registered.</li>
<li>Messages rejected at&hellip; Displays the number of messages rejected at the department(s), regardless of where the message was registered.</li>

<p>Use the drop-down menu for Period Type if you want a different periodisation than the automatic. If the time frame you are searching for does not cover an entire period, the last period and the total period (first column in the table) will show a time frame that spans an entire period. However, there will not be any data in the report from outside the time frame you have selected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Messages that are not yet closed may be part of the overview for process time withouth being included in the report for close time. Therefore, it is possible to have longer processing time than close time.</li>
<li>To calculate the processing time we use only the latest department the message was sent to - the current department.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="message-form">Message form</h4>
<p>If a particular message form is selected here, only messages registered with the selected message form will be included in the report.</p>

<p>If a category group is selected here, only messages with check marks in the selected category group will be included in the report.</p>
<h3 id="graph-types">Graph types</h3>
<p>A series of checkboxes that activate or deactivate the given graph type. Overview by forms, status and priority are activated as standard. This can be changed on a per customer basis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Overview by departments: Displays an overview of the messages that are registered on the department which is selected in the Navigator and the messages that are registered on its subordinate departments.</li>
<li>Overview by forms: Displays the message forms that have been in use. This graph is hidden if a message form is selected in the drop-down menu above.</li>
<li>Overview by status: Displays the status of the messages.</li>
<li>Overview by priority: Displays the priority of the messages.</li>
<li>Distribution over time: Displays when the messages were registered. The time axis changes according to the length of the selected period. Possible scales: days, weeks, months and years.</li>
<li>Overview by categories: Displays one graph for each category group with which a registration was done.</li>
<li>Overview by users: Does not appear in the standard version. Shows how many messages the users of the selected department have registered. Users registered on another department who have done registrations on the selected department are also shown. Messages reported as anonymous are not included in these graphs.</li>
<li>Dynamic graphs: Any graph defined in Admin / Rules / Configuration for dynamic graphs is shown here. These are graphs where the local system administrator can choose which values come on the Y-axis and the X-axis.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-graphs">The graphs</h3>
<p>Each graph has a series of checkboxes that control what it contains and what kind of graph will show.</p>
<ul>
<li>Swap axis: Swaps the data shown on the x and y axes in the graph.</li>
<li>Show total: Appears only for category graphs.
<ul>
<li>Checked: The first segment of the bar contains the summarized totals for the following segments of the same bar. The subsequent segments of the bar show the sum from the respective department (see graph legend) and from its subordinate departments. Used if, for example, you want to get all the messages in the whole company for which a given category is checked.</li>
<li>Not checked: The first segment of the bar shows only the registrations from the department which is selected in the Navigator. The subsequent segments of the bar show also here the sum from the respective department (see graph legend) and from its subordinate departments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Message count: The graph that shows the number of messages appears. This is by default preselected for all graphs, except for the category graphs for the category groups of the type Number.</li>
<li>Sum: Appears only for category groups of the type Number. It is by default preselected for them. This type of category groups is answered with a number instead of a tick. This graph shows the sum of these numbers for all messages included in the report.</li>
<li>Percent chart: Shows the percentage distribution.
<ul>
<li>For graphs other than the category graphs this means that the message count graph is scaled to 100.</li>
<li>For category graphs it displays the percentage distribution of messages for each department per category within each category group. Each department sums up to 100% in this graph, so some bars could exceed 100. In this case, the graphs might be more readable if swapped. Use the Swap axis for this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cost chart: Displays the sum of the cost field in the messages that the graph contains. When you click on a cost chart you will only see cases with cost &gt; 0.</li>

<p>The tab Risk contains all the risk messages in the system from the active departments. Risk messages are messages that are used to create a risk overview for the company. It is up to the company if the risk messages will be handled or if they will only be registered and stored in the archive. Our recommendation is that they are not handled, only updated annually. Messages registered here do not appear in the Inbox unless you use the Message process page to handle them. The message type risk message is not enabled in the standard version. When performing a search either from Reports, from the Message search or by clicking on the risk matrix, the selected search criteria are shown in a separate table above the results table.</p>

<li>The numbers in the risk matrix show only categories from messages in the table below.</li>
<li>The Navigator is used to set the starting department for the risk overview.</li>
<li>Click on a field in the matrix to look only at the messages that have categories in this field. This is performed as a search and changes the selected tab. The risk field in the search criteria shows which field you clicked on.</li>

    <div class="lead">A message is a filled out message form used for storing a registration in the system.</div>
	<p>A message can be attached to one or more actions. An action can also be attached to one or more messages. A message can be attached to several actions regardless of what status the message has.</p>
<p>Messages are registered and modified under Edit message and processed in the Message process page.</p>
<p>Messages is the general name for normal messages, risk messages, log messages and comment messages. Risk messages and log messages are not activated in the standard version. They are identical to the regular messages except that they are intended to be used in a different way.</p>
<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>Categories: A message can have an unlimited number of selected categories.</li>
<li>Text fields: A message can have an unlimited number of text fields. In the standard version, messages usually have two text fields.</li>
<li>Priority: Shows the priority of the message. Can have the values Low (green), Medium (yellow), High (red). It is set automatically based on pre-coded values for the selected categories. Can be overridden by the message originator and the case handler.</li>

<li>Registration date: When the registered incident occurred.</li>
<li>Registered by user: The user who did the registration.</li>
<li>Registered on behalf of user: The user reporting the message. It is this user who will be the message originator.</li>

<li>Operative department: The department where the actual case handler of the message is registered.</li>
<li>Status: Possible status values for a message:
<ul>
<li>New: A message gets the status &ldquo;new&rdquo; when it is registered.</li>

<li>Rejected: A message that has been rejected. This is closed and can not be processed further.</li>
<li>Action in progress: A message that is attached to at least one action that is not approved.</li>
<li>Closed: A message that is attached only to actions that have been approved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GPS coordinates: Messages registered through the mobile application send the GPS coordinates of the location of the mobile device at the time of registration. Displayed in the Message process page only if this is set in the Edit message form page and if the user of the app had location services enabled on his / her device at the time of registration. If you click on the coordinates, a new page opens with the map of the specified location.</li>
<li>Documents: The uploaded files, either via the mobile app or the Upload file function. File name, date and time of upload are displayed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="access-control">Access control</h3>
<p>All messages are registered on a department and get the status New or Sent to case handler if the selection of the case handler is made in the registration page. What kind of access a user has to a message is determined by the status and department of the message, and the user type, the department and the roles of the user.</p>

    <div class="lead">Tab under Inbox and Archive.</div>
	<p>A message form has checkboxes or drop-down menus and text fields specified by the company&rsquo;s super user. At least one field will have an orange-like background colour. Orange fields are mandatory and must be filled out so that the message can be saved.</p>
<p>When a message is saved, it is registered on the department that is written in the top of the middle column in the message form. The message will appear immediately in the Inbox of the person(s) that is defined as the manager of the selected department, unless the early case process is enabled, see below. The message will also appear immediately under Reports and in the reports created from the same or a subordinate department.</p>
<h3 id="filling-out-the-form">Filling out the form</h3>

<li>Remember to check something in all the fields with an orange-like background colour. There will usually be one such field in the upper left part of the screen. You will get an error message if you try to save a message and there are mandatory fields that have not been filled out. Please note that if there are more than one fields marked with

, you will only be able to select one category from all of them.</li>
<li>Checkboxes:
<ul>
<li>Single choice: Fields that have a round box in front of each option. That means that you can select one option in this group. Once you have selected one option in a single choice field, then you can not take it away again.</li>
<li>Multiple choice: Fields that have a square box in front of each option. Here you can check any number alternatives or none at all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check boxes and enter text in the fields you feel that apply to you. It may be that some message forms are general and that only some fields are relevant in your situation.</li>
<li>Remember that the person who handles your message can make changes, typically write down additional information and change the cost field and priority.</li>
<li>If there is a suggestion field, type your suggestion there. It is important for the improving process of the business. Some companies reward the month&rsquo;s or half the year&rsquo;s best suggestions for improvement.</li>
<li>Priority: This field gets a value based on the selections you make in the message form. This value can be overridden.</li>
<li>Cost: This field is meant to represent the actual cost of the registered message. This field gets a value based on the selections you make in the message form. This value can be overwritten. Super users can remove the cost field from a message form.</li>
<li>Risk assessment: Some message forms may have a built-in risk assessment. In some cases, you should then evaluate the probability and the consequence that the registered event will happen again, in other cases you should evaluate the probability and the consequence for a hypothetical event. The risk value is then automatically calculated and displayed with a colour at the corresponding location in the risk matrix.</li>
<li>Numeric fields: Categories can be displayed as numeric fields instead of checkboxes. Such numeric fields can be used to report for example the number of liters of water consumption or other number or quantity statements.</li>

<h3 id="early-case-process">Early case process</h3>
<p>This field appears only for messages that are not saved and only if it is enabled for the message form you are looking at. Activation of Early case process is not recommended for new customers unless they have special requirements.
Early case process means that the message can be assigned to a responsible person already when it is being registered. Normally this is not done by the person who registers the message but only when a manager or case handler is processing the case on the department where the message was registered. The Early case process can be activated by users with user type Manager on the top department or by users who have the system role Content administrator. This can be done under Admin / Rules, Rule type &ldquo;Early case handlers&rdquo; if you create such a rule for a message form. It is also possible to activate an option that shows a menu in the New message page similar to the &ldquo;Send to case handler&rdquo; drop-down in the Message process page. With this option you do not need &ldquo;Early case handler&rdquo; rules, but they can be used even if this option is on and the drop-down menu in the New message page will only show those.</p>
<ul>
<li>Send to case handler / line manager: Drop-down menu where you can choose to whom this message will be sent. This does not change the department on which the message is registered, even if the selected user is in another department.</li>
<li>Send email: If this is checked here, an email will be sent to the selected user when you press the Save button.</li>

Those you can send the message to are those who have the user type manager or case handler on your own department, the department above it in the hierarchy or one of the departments under your own. You can also send the message to those who are set up under the tab Rules with the rule type &ldquo;Additional case handlers&rdquo; with a remit that includes your department. Please note that for messages that are created with message forms which have a role with the &ldquo;See messages&rdquo; limitation, those who do not satisfy that limitation will be taken off this list. You can set a deadline for when the person you send it to should have done something about it.</li>
<li>Return to former case handler: Used when you want to transfer the responsibility for the message back to someone who had it before. This option is only shown when a message has changed case handler at least once.</li>

	<p>One must have the system role &ldquo;System role administrator&rdquo; to be able to make changes to the page.</p>
<p>Note 1: Be very careful when you make changes to the user type you are logged in with. It may be impossible to reverse your changes if you change the wrong access, for example if you take away your own user type&rsquo;s access to the Admin tab.</p>
<p>Note 2. All changes done to user types will take effect immediately for all users who are logged in with that user type, with the exception of tabs of the top level. The page needs to be reloaded to see changes there. This can be done for example by pressing the F5 key on your keyboard.</p>
